abstract={The number of databases as well as their size and complexity is increasing. This creates a barrier to use especially for non-experts, who have to come to grips with the nature of the data, the way it has been represented in the database, and the specific query languages or user interfaces by which data are accessed. These difficulties worsen in research settings, where it is common to work with many different databases. One approach to improving this situation is to allow users to pose their queries in natural language. In this work we describe a machine learning framework, Polyglotter, that in a general way supports the mapping of natural language searches to database queries. Importantly, it does not require the creation of manually annotated data for training and therefore can be applied easily to multiple domains. The framework is polyglot in the sense that it supports multiple different database engines that are accessed with a variety of query languages, including SQL and Cypher. Furthermore Polyglotter supports multi-class queries. Good performance is achieved on both toy and real databases, as well as a human-annotated WikiSQL query set. Thus Polyglotter may help database maintainers make their resources more accessible.},

abstract = {Recent advances in natural language understanding and processing resulted in renewed interest in natural language based interfaces to data, which provide an easy mechanism for non-technical users to access and query the data. While early systems only allowed simple selection queries over a single table, some recent work supports complex BI queries, with many joins and aggregation, and even nested queries. There are various approaches in the literature for interpreting user's natural language query. Rule-based systems try to identify the entities in the query, and understand the intended relationships between those entities. Recent years have seen the emergence and popularity of neural network based approaches which try to interpret the query holistically, by learning the patterns. In this tutorial, we will review these natural language interface solutions in terms of their interpretation approach, as well as the complexity of the queries they can generate. We will also discuss open research challenges.},
