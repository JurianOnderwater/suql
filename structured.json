            "Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...\n\nAmbience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only \ud83d\ude02. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!\n\nStarters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!\n\nDelicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate \ud83d\ude1b( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.\n\nDesserts ahhahahhhaa!!!\nYou have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!\n\nThe ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.\n\nOnly drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!\n\nI would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!\n\nSection wise Ratings:\n\nAmbience: 3.5/5\nStaff: 3.5/5\nFood: 4/5\nBuffet items: 4.5/5\nOverall: 4/5",

            "I\u2019m not going to this place again. Though the ambiance is good, Flechazo Gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. We went there as a family. The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.\nThe place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.\nBut for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place.",

Tastewise it seemed average but as I was hungry I finished it fast. Fell asleep at 2AM to wake up at 5AM with a severe upset stomach. This went on and when I woke up by 10AM my stomach still hurt. I'm pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene  standards. Nonetheless if they keep this up they'll gradually lose their clientele. Would recommend a place called Cafe 555. Their haleem is far tastier and doesn't come with the complimentary food poisoning.",

We also have the habit of adding pathar ka gosht on top to make it taste even more delicious.",

The taste of the biryani is so unique that I can close my eyes, taste the biryani and tell that it's Shah Ghouse Biryani....\n\nI deducted one point for the behaviour, which could have been better. Not pointing towards any specific scenario but I would prefer ordering online from Shah Ghouse than going there and eating, specially when I am late.\n\nThe quality sets it apart from its competition.

Although they have opened an outlet in Hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. So on Sunday 19th May, 2019, it was time for redemption. We visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, I could figure out that it was a full house!\n\nAmbiance\n===========\nAt the reservation table, we were courteously greeted. Then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at \"Panjim\" restaurant. We would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats, but unfortunately all were reserved! Starting from decors, live music, the lighting, well all I could say was that place was lively! The ambiance may not be as good as their South Goa outlet, but its not lagging that far, either! Ratings - 4/5.\n\nService\n===========\nAs we were seated indoors at the \"Panjim\" restaurant, Himanshu was in-charge of our table. He was polite , courteous and efficient.  He was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time. Top-notch! Ratings - 5/5.\n\nFood\n===========\nTa-da, here comes the big deal! My wife had prawn curry rice and I had fish and chips.   The prawn curry had thick gravy, prepared with coconut milk and Goan spices and tasted yum!  It was served with steamed rice. For the fish and chips fillet, well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well. It was served with tarter dip! I was really impressed with the food, and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in Hyderabad, is a pure bliss! Ratings - 4.5/5.\n\nValue for Money\n=============\nHmm, its a very important point! Is the food served, worth the price? Absolutely yes! My bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner, and I am not complaining! Ratings - 4/5.\n\nLets calculate,\n\nRating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.375\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n============= \nIf you love live music, Goan shack kinda experience and good sea food, then its a must visit! Probably one of the best place to chill out in Hyderabad.",
            "Visited this place about a month ago and they weren't very accommodating as we had our 5 month old baby with us which led us to walk out ASAP. They were relatively low on customer service with us but no complaints about the food. Tried the fish&chips and prawn curry with rice last week and was decent.",
            "One of the best fine dining restaurant in Hyderabad . Superb ambiance and great service. I personally loved the place and the way they treat .\n\nTried spring roll, Tempura squid ,Drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao. Fish tasted awesome. Overall starters were great and you will not be disappointed.\n\nComing to main course ,tried mixed veg pulao and Dak bungalow chicken. Pulao could have been better. One more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao.\n\nOverall one will enjoy the ambiance and food. Better to have a reservation during weekends.\n\nAmbiance--5/5\n\nTaste--4/5\n\nQuality and Quantity --4/5\n\nService--5/5\n\nPresentation--4/5",
            "Food is great here. Surprisingly even veg food was good. we ordered variety of veg and non veg starters and food was simply awesome. Their staff is very coordial too. Live music and the goa feel adds to lot of fun. I believe the photographs talks itself for amazing ambience they have to offer.",
            "Great ambiance, its a theme from Goa but I'd say its better than Goa itself.\nThe food was amazing, the service was great, and everything was organized.\nMy favorite dish out of all would be their pasta.\n\nWould definitely love to visit again.",
            "Goan themed restaurant with great picturesque view and vastly spread. Great place to chill all around the day. The price is a bit on the higher side.\nOrdered Zafrani Paneer tikka , amritsari fish tikka and butter garlic prawns for starters. Fish tikka was okayish, paneer nice and the prawns were delicious.\nTried thai green chicken curry with Jasmine rice for main course along with butter/garlic naan, daal tadka and paneer butter masala. Loved the thao curry.\nThey offer multiple options in cocktails and mocktails, however the prices are a bit high on the pocket. Had the best long island ice tea till date.\nAll in all a great experience.",
            "I have been there with my family. Mainly the ambiance and appetizers are just amazing.\nAnother main asset of the restaurant is the way there are presenting the food.",
            "Excellent ambience, great food and service... There starters, desserts and mocktails are absolutely delicious. The main course is above average. That's what makes this place a 5 star fine dining restaurant. They have different sections both open and covered and named under Goan beaches. They have a fresh catch section, from where you can choose fishes, crabs and lobsters and ask them to prepare it.",
            "Goan food at its best! This place is as good as it's sister outlet in Goa. Mimicking the Goan ambience, this place is breezy and beautiful for an evening dining experience.\n\nThe food had great flavours, brilliantly cooked juicy prawns and the coconut sambol like side just tingle your taste buds. The southern fish fry and masala fried prawns are a delight! Great lighting and courteous staff.\n\nTried the south indian fish curry and rice. Probably not the best I've had, but all the other dishes made up for this.\n\nMust try: masala fried prawns, kadhai jhinga, mutton xacuti, pinwheel delight (mushrooms)\n\nWould give it a 4.5/5 just because of the prawns!",
            "The ambience is really good. The food is good and especially the starters are delicious. Butter prawns were the best. We were given a great service by Mr Naveen. Would definitely recommend this place.",
            "One of the best places to chill in Hyderabad after a long week\u2019s hard work. Love the place, the ambiance reminds of Goa and the food definitely yes. I love the prawns and the sea food, especially the butter friend prawns and the prawn Balchoa. The drinks added for the flavour, I would recommend for a nice evening, but check the reservations before hand, the first time I went had to wait for more than 25 mins. Service is great. Overall a 5 star rating.",
            "Good for a nice Sunday brunch. The buffet for two is 1500 INR, and worth the deal, I'd say. The ambience is also great and you do get a lot of seating options. Would recommend.",
            "This place makes you feel like you are at the shore of a beautiful beach in goa, sipping on your favourite drink and just taking the whole feeling. Designed to make you feel like your on vacation, it ticks all the right boxes for a foodie like me. Different sections of the restaurants are named after various places in goa,making it a perfect place to feel like you are on a vacation. We had the potato rechado which was spicy and very flavourful.Mushroom tonak and Mix veg foogath with vegetable pulao was our main course which we enjoyed as well. It is the place if u want to try goan cuisine.",
            "Perfect place for corporate dine outs. Had a great time with my team dinner. Wide variety of Goan dishes and other food as well as \"beverages\". A bit expensive but OK. The private space was good at 'Margarita lounge'",
            "Overpriced! Coming to the weekends they doesn't make the food tasty! Fish was not good there is no flavor at all I the food . And 3* only for the ambience"

All thanks to SG biryani's which made me order Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma from this new venture without even thinking about it. The delivery, packaging, taste and quantity was perfect. Trust me this shawarma was too heavy and yummy. It came without vegetables, and i felt mayonnaise was less and not till the end, it is always best to have little extra mayo!",

The Rumali was fat shawarma (means the shawarma was mota) the only concern I had was there was a lot of coriander leaves. I should have given instructions. The taste of those leaves were kind of predominant at times. Except that great and the mayo and sauce addition was great and got 2 packets of ketchup as well. Totally; I am happy with the shawarma and cost effective as well.",

Interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony.\nIf you ask me, can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony. My favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day.\nWhen it comes to food.\nFirst dish was :\nGreen veg Galouti : Mince of green packed with galouti masala, onion - cashew paste and smoked with clove(laung). The kebabs are so soft, that they just melt in mouth.\n Achari daal croquette : Achar flavoured daal puree rolls, coated with Panko crumbs and deep fried. And the tomato chutney served with it, just enhance the taste.\nMoong daal cheese chilla : Minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa. It was decent.\nChole bathure : The chutney was so good. Served with potato curry.\n Galouti's are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and Mutton Galouti  is just perfect at hyperlocal.\nHad few Mocktails but my pick was kiwi based Mocktail. Full marks for the presentations.\nChicken tikka: This can never go Wrong. It was very good.\nChicken taco : Will make it simple. Just loved it.\nHeard alot about desserts. Next visit will be desserts. Will keep you posted friends :)\nOver all the experience was good. Interior might not be the best looking one, Still looks decent but the balcony I must say.

That view Enticed me and I just walked toward it to see that beauty happening. I couldn't wait to try that Super appetising Chops and delicious Raan!\n\nBesides they also got chicken Shawarma and MUTTON HALEEM Which is another different delicacy storyline...\nI had to take a big bowl of Haleem with some birista and dash of lemon squeez and Final touch with Two spoons of Ghee. Yes that's my style! \ud83d\ude09\n\nI walked to see few more exciting dishes and I found the legendary Badami Gosht! Yes just the glance of it made my mouth water and besides Murgh Mussalam was also calling me with its own aroma, that spread of cream on it made it look like show stopper and make anyone try and lick their fingers...\n\nCannot miss Thier Gosht Biryani \ud83d\ude0b one fine plate of heaven where every spice and meat married so well. Perfectly tender meat and soft and Fragrant basmati with a touch of Ghee!\n\nOnly because of the taste and being foodie I had two rounds of everything and was full...\nBut there's always a another stomach for kulfi!\nPan-Pista-malai, Voila!",

Have been to the restaurant in different cities, and have noticed some significant differences across all locations.\nThis Gachibowli BBQ Nation has some items missing from its live counter, but have curd rice which wasn\u2019t available in any other location I have been to.\nThe staff is extremely courteous.

            "Food quality is good. But not so many items, like crabs, octopus, kofta are available , particularly in this branch which are available at other branches of BN or ABs. So, it was really disappointing.\n\nAlso service was a bit slow, we really had to wait for items to come on our table in between. That really turns off our mood though the waiters are jolly n try to make us feel good. I think the number of waiters are less.\n\nAC facility was good, very cold.\n\nBut I don\u2019t recommend this place.",

This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.\n\nThe only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.\n\nEverything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.\n\nThe starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.\n\nThe chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.\n\nI would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.\n\nHope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together.",

I must admit that I was pretty much humbled by the chef coming over very often and asking if the food was up to our satisfaction. The starters alone were enough to fill up my belly. When it came to having the main course, the options were not many but it suffficed, I would say. The waiters were patient enough to serve us whatever we needed and we all left with a happy note and fat bellies.",

They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.\nNo body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.\nFinally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.\nEven if the food was not good, I would not give such rating.

            "Friday night visited there with my girl gang. I had booked the table in order to avoid any hastle. Was seated in a quiet corner on the deck side of the space. I loved the food they served\u2014 each and every item. The DJ for that night was very good and we danced till the last song! Only the service a bit dissatisfying because the bill was generated incorrectly and over the amount what we had consumed. Expect better care to be taken !",
            "It was a night out with gal pals.\n\nWhen we entered, the server took us to our sitting area , we chose a corner, as it had a couch ,felt it was bit secluded.\n\nWarm indoors, black and brown seatings, cartoons of laal street, their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the TV.\n\nThey have their own app for ordering , but guess what their wifi wasn't available ,as it was under repair. That is what server told us.\n\nThe server came and took our orders.\n\nWe ordered starters and drinks.\n\nAs soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere.\n\nIt kind of scared us , then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation.\n\nThen we started enjoying the music and our orders came. The server got one of the drinks wrong, we reminded him it was changed ,he said he already brought this.\n\nOther places, the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast. Instead he said he cant take it back.\n\nAnyways moving on\n\nThe cocktail which i had were really good. The cosmopolitan, Beer trap and Screw driver.\n\nThe starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small. I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian. Italian cheese fingers - They were crispy and yum, Stuffed mushrooms - they were okay and forgettable, the Nachos were okay , have had better ones . The crispy corn was good . Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters.\n\nThe music was good , Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it, first they said at 9.30 they will start ,then said 10.30 it will start. We four were only on the dance floor , we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song. He didnt oblige at all.\n\nWould playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills ? God knows.\n\nFood and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar.\n\nHope they improve their hospitality. That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again.\n\nFood -3/5\nService-3/5\nOverall experience - 4/5 ( Because of friends)\nVFM- 3.5/5",
            "They always deny the table on weekends or Friday even though we book on Zomato or other apps due to high demand, this is not fair if we did a pre booking",
            "Went here on a Thursday, the staff were really pathetic in service and no Zomato Gold etc were eligible. They could have responded in a proper way when asked why it's not valid. (since it's ladies night)",
            "The most happening place in the city. Been here enjoyed everything but only thing they didn't allow us to dance as we were stags.\nFood -3\nAmbience -4\nService -3",
            "Cocktails were really good and service was cool and great atmosphere ,loved it, will be back again to enjoy the food and drinks...\nAmbience 5/5\nService 5/5\nFood 5.5/5",
            "GOOD PLACE TO HANGOUT WITH FRIENDS. NICE MUSIC NICE AMBIENCE NICE FOOD.\nIt also has a outdoor seating so one who likes to have that seating. it is also a good place with good atmosphere.\nIts a Bar Exchange so Order wisely that's the only thing to Take Care of.\nIf you are traveling to hyd. and don't want to go any random place for pubbing. You surely can rely on this place."

The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.\n\nComing to the food:\nVegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.\n\nNon- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.\n\nThe main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.\n\nThe sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.\n\nAgain kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience!!",

But, they didnt. when i've approached Zomato, i was told that there is nothing that they can do about it. Here is the twist of the tale -   instead of refund or replacement, i was only given 150 ruppes zomato credits.

The puris were fat and oily. The alu curry was more like hing(asafoetida) Curry and had to dig through the gravy for choley. Our breakfast was definitely spoiled. In my last order of Rajma-chawal, same thing had happened. I really had to search for the rajmas in the gravy.\nWish the management will work upon the food quality.

Delicious mushroom soup and the Quattro Formaggi is a wonderful burst of different cheeses in your mouth!

The sushi (even the veg variant) was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb.\n\nService however was lacking on all parameters. It was cold and inefficient. It was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did, they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out (couple of women in particular - could not catch their names). The billing too took an unreasonable amount of time.\n\nThe food here is great, but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to 3. Quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant.\n\nWill we return? Perhaps not in the near future - the only reason we would return at some point would be Zomato Gold on the food.",

The food here is really good.Unlike others, I will start with the dessert-love their creme brule the best and followed by their baked cheesecakes..Have tried their chickn burgers, pizzas and thai cuisine as well--i loved the burgers the best, followed by Thai curry..Buffet was less impressive than ala carte but was happy with the variety-whic included Hyderabadi cuisine apart form meditteranean...must place to visit in Hydereabad.",
            "Went for lunch with friends...ala carte. Liked the ambience,though it was really far to get to!! We had the Caesar salad, which was fresh and could have used a bit more seasoning; Pizza arabiata-really nice, crust thin and ingredients fresh and tasty! Penne pasta-chicken was also good, though the chicken seemed dry. The best dish was Thai green curry vegetables which was served with a jasmine rice-the best ever flavours-a must try!! Now coming to the desserts- we had the philadelphia cheese cake baked-nice plating but cheesecake can be improved significantly. Creme brule was good--loved the crispy carmelized sugar crust.\nThere was a lot of crowd and it took us a long time to get our orders. Overall it was a nice experience, hope to have a better one next time.",

Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).\nIt tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone!

Do not go with their briyani picturs shown on website in reality its only rice packed in some big attractive boxesNever try biryani here , However we were shocked to find just one piece of mutton in the Biryani. Not sure how Behrouz expected us to consume the box full of rice with a small piece of mutton. We have decided not to order anymore from this restaurant. worst of a kind and never tasted such filthy biryani in my life , and secondly they are charging bomb price for such filthy biryani ie 379 \nNo taste and no quality.

Were little concerened if made the right choice...but VOILA.. on the event day we were very very happy to see the below specific observations:\n1.Quality of Food - We have given few instructions on the buffet spread and also asked for North Indian taste in food. The instructions that we have given was executed line by line...not an inch of difference... Food was great...I got lot of enquires from guests that how did I locate this place... Very Very satisfied... Must taste from my side- Bengal fish curry and Nizami Handi..\n\nThe starters typically was in taking terms among the guests... Awsome..\n\n2. Service- The staff was courtious and they took care of each guests personally.. It was no less than a private party, though we havn't booked the restaurant fully...but seeing the service we  were very happy... \n\n3. Ambience- The restaurant is cleanly decorated..not so much noise in decor... As we want a special moment and we were in doubt how to setup the environment with some personal touch, the staff themselves took the lead and asked for few items in the morning...and when we entered in the evenning we were quite surprised to see the decoration just the right.. this is called the owning of stuff... \n\nKudos to the staff and management for taking our request and customizing every bit of the arrangements as per the need of the event... VERY HAPPY...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...ALL STARS...",

If you want authentic Hyderabadi biryani, then this should be a default option. \n\nHave tried multiple dishes from this place so this is kind of a general review. \n\nThe chicken biryani is their specialility. Large fragrant rice which are flaky and yet not oily provide a perfect blend with juicy chicken pieces. Only note is that they serve with one giant chicken piece in the biryani. Smaller pieces would make the biryani more manageable. The quantity is definitely something where even 4 people can easily enjoy a meal.\n\nWe tried their haleem too in this Ramzan and it was delicious. Creamy texture with generous chunks of mutton and a small spicy kick to the taste, something which I really prefer in my haleem. \n\nAvoid going for a dine-in given the crowd but for home delivery, this is a place where you can order anything with eyes closed.\n\nFood - 5/5\nValue for money - 4/5\nPackaging - 4/5",

The servings of Biryani was overwhelming and very filling. The regular serving was more than one normal person could eat. But the taste was average and nothing new. The chicken was cooked well.\n\nThe ambience was good but a little too full.

            "One of our favourite places for hangout. The biryani is mildly spicy and not very oily which we really appreciate. Kababs are great too. Isnt very heavy on your wallet so we normally visit this place one every week when office's food vendor provides less than average food.",
            "Absolutely overhyped place. Substandard biryani and kababs, totally dry and tasteless. No dress code for waiters, hardly any waiters anyway. Pathetic service. I guess each and every place in Hyderabad, which is being talked about, be it pista house or paradise, are totally over hyped.",
            "Pista house is the restaurant which comes in mind when it comes to Biriyani and Haleen. But I tried Chinese here and I must say the dishes tasted too good. A very decent restaurant with reasonable price."

There are variety of dishes available here.\n\nI ordered pahadi chicken in starter. It had this taste of spinach and it tasted good with mint chutney otherwise quite bland.

The food was so yummy and the ambience was very good.\nMust try dish is non-veg Chinese platter in which we get fish, prawns, chicken drumsticks and other 2 types of chicken also. It costs around 800/- but it is definitely very much worthy. And the butter naan was so soft n nice. And the assorted chicken Mandi was also yummy.\nOverall it is one of the best restaurants I have visited. Everything was satisfactory.",

First thing we got was Chicken Tangdi and what I instantly noticed was that it was deep fried, which is not a norm and wasn\u2019t juicy; all we could taste was charcoal. This made our expectations very low.\n\nIn the mean time, I asked them to get the Coke I ordered; it wasn\u2019t chilled. Hence, I requested them to get Ice. To my surprise, they had no ice.\n\nAnd finally, we got our biryani. It was not bad; but, there were no Meaty pieces of Mutton; Only bones.\n\nMy advice to you all would be that the food is edible but don\u2019t keep your expectations too high.",

Not a single stand out dish , chettinad chicken was salty and inspite of me telling them multiple times they turned a deaf ear. Deserts are so so. Biryani was fine but chicken was very dry , same case with the fish starter just horrible. Fruit custard had only bananas.even their water tasted like chemically treated.

But I happened to order the egg soft noodles from the place and it tasted really good and the quantity was pretty filling. The biryani of the place is packed with flavors and accompanied by perfectly Cooked meat. If you are a biryani person and want to try some of the best this place should be on your list.",

Otherwise all the things were nice including ambiance and the serving and the taste of the food was good. I'll prefer to go once more and taste other things too.",
            "We were here for a new joinee party with team of 10 people, buffet lunch.\nOverwhelmed with their service and courtesy 4/5\nTasty, delicious,mouth watering 4+4 starters were served which were amazing\nA paradise for Biryani lovers, never expected Biryani in main course would be this amazing anywhere else\nThe varieties in desserts is quite different here, which included 'KA' for all-\nDouble Ka metta, kadu ka kheer, gajar ka Halwa, kubani Ka metta.\nRate the buffet(food)- 5/5\nAmbience-4/5\nServicing- 4/5\nWould definitely visit again\ud83d\ude01",
            "Well... After going through a lot of positive reviews we finally decided to visit this place. We opted to go for buffet option. The taste of the soup would have been better if it has been served hot. Coming to starters they served 4 non veg and 4 veg starters. Out of the non veg starters apart from Tandoori chicken nothing tasted great or not even good. Especially Apollo fish was not even cooked properly. Out of the 4 veg starters only panner pakoda tasted better, that\u2019s what my vegetarian friends said. Coming to the main course they served rotis prepared with Maida which I never try. The only thing I liked out of all the main course is mutton curry. Starting from chicken biryani and sweets like Gajar ka halwa, double ka meetha everything was served cold (Probably they forgot to turn on the burners). Finally it\u2019s ice cream time which melted even before they served on the table. On a whole it was a bad experience. I would like to suggest the management one thing, If you are not really willing to serve buffet option over the weekdays better don\u2019t."

The music was good, the only downside to the whole thing was that the person giving out drinks at the counter was downright ignoring us. We actually became a little uncomfortable after that, because we were right in front of him, waving hands (not drunk at all, because we were asking for out first drink of the night), and he was handing out drinks to everyone else except us.

Even their virgin mohito was not gud.Then the food was also okish.Staff were also not courteous.I find the place was overcrowded. It seemed they have allowed stag entries and they were passing cheap comment on us.I will never recommend anyone here.",

Only issues .... the tables are small, and hence not much can be placed on the table. Saw lots of bottles fall and break. But regardless, this is a good place if you really wanna party hard.",

It was fine then but slowly the suffocation started. There is no proper ventilation, guessing based on the experience I had. Whichever club, I have been to, there is a separate outdoor place dedicated for smoking. The restaurant or a pub or a club will have outdoor dinning area to address this issue. But here at this place, i couldn't see an open window. It was all dark! I think they really took \"Rogue\" word to another level.\nI couldn't enjoy at all, came from there when it was too much for me, now i have got this itching in my throat and cold just because of all that cigarette smoke.\nI would really want Club Rogue to address this issue, it was very depressing for me and I think the same was felt by so many people over there."

At 2500 INR plus taxes per head we expected the basics, quality service & excellent food.\n\nImagine our shock when we received exactly the opposite. \n\n1. The linen on the table we were seated at had cigarette holes in it. \n2. The livery was stained.\n3. The restaurant hadn't set up yet even though it was 2130 hrs by the time we arrived.\n4. Instead of being given comfortable seating, we were given plastic chairs with white wraps on them.\n5. The Cream of Asparagus soup was like toilet water. So was the Avocado Chicken Corn Chowder Soup. They refused to give us extra croutons because we've already eaten too many. What else is one supposed to do when you are served such bad tasting soup?\n6. The Bharwab Subz Kebab was dry like dried meat, the Grilled Buffalo Chicken was terrible smelling only - How to eat?, the Lamb Galouti was decent and the Vegetable Lumpia was oily and tiny. - All in All the appetizers were equally useless.\n7. Moving onto the Main course now - For the Vegetarian Me, i was given a choice between the Anjeer Kesar Kofte and Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli. I obviously chose the latter D-uh. Big Mistake. When i asked the server why the ravioli was so dry, i was told that the halogen lamp made it so. Then why keep it under the lamp for so long? And the former you ask, it was so sweet, it was like drinking Chaasni - the sugar water from the Rasgulla or Gulab Jamun dabba.\n8. Not like the Non-Vegetarians had it any better. 6 Hours Braised Lamb Shank OR Nalli Nihari OR Murgh Methi. \nLamb - It was more bones than lamb and also, baby lamb Such a tiny piece that my husband had to eat another dinner after we got home.\nNalli Nihari - More like Nal ka Paani. No taste no Nihari.\nMurgh Methi - WhyWhyWhy so many bones in a dosh which one assumes is boneless and that too in a 5 star hotel. Roti you ask? - Please DO NOT.\n9. And last but not the least, Dessert.\nVanilla Bean Pannacotta - I make better Pannacotta and i just wanted to cry. The coulis was just sugar water with some red colouring.\nKesar Malai Kulfi - This was bought from Scoops. The server told us also. The only thing on the menu that tasted fantastic. Ate 4 and went home.",

On the 13tb floor next to pool having drinks and food with your close friends was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this place to all. Food was very tasty and filling. After ages I must have had so tasty and upto the mark Rogan Ghosh. I would be visiting again with my wife to this place and would like to spend some quality time.

            "Instagram | veganyums_\n\nLooking for a romantic dinner? I would say this is one of the best place in Hyderabad. Amazing ambience along the poolside. My review is based on the session invite.\n\nWe started our dinner with Thai coconut soup. Perfectly cooked veggies like carrot, broccoli, zucchini dipped into the coconut milk. It was very tasty.\n\nIn starters, we were served Beetroot paneer Tikka and Sikampuri kebab. Plating was very tempting. Paneer Tikka goes really well with the chutney they served with it. And the kebab, it was the best Sikampuri kebab I have ever had. Perfectly cooked and moist inside.\n\nIn mocktails, they suggested their best sellers which were apple cooler and minty mango. Apple cooler was little tangy and minty mango was on sweeter side. I just loved the latter one. It was very refreshing.\n\nThen comes the main course. We had Malai kofta - modak shaped kofta layered with cashew curry. Sweetness was balanced and delicious in taste. Must try with their herb paratha. We also had Stuffed capsicum - one of the famous and ultimate dish in India. If you have only curry, you may find it salty, but have it with capsicum and you will feel it like a heaven.\n\nIn dessert, I had brownie with vanilla ice cream. Brownie was nice, soft, crispy outside and moist inside.\n\nOverall, my experience was amazing with Mazzo. Bhuvnesh - the main chef is very humble person and his suggestions were really helpful while having a dinner. I also enjoyed the service from their courteous staff.",

            "Today I had an awesome experience at Mazzo @Marriot. We wanted a lot of customization on the food and our Chef @Aritra personally made sure that our food was above our expectations with those intricacies taken care of. It was just a pleasure to talk to him as he himself became our host for the evening.\n1. The ambience beside the pool was great2. Great hospitality starting from manager to our Chef and the person who attended to us.3. Great view4. Our chef made our evening by adding his suggestions and giving us a discount too.5. Food was great\nGreat place to visit with family and special person.",

Mr.Gopal Singh served us, the service was excellent. Would greatly recommend this place to come with your loved ones.\nAmbience - 5/5\nFood - 3.5/5\nService - 5/5",

It's like any normal restaurant with basic interiors. We have to wait 25-30mins after order something. We had grilled chicken, butter chicken, butter naan, rumali roti and chicken biryani.

The cost was nearly the same as in Chennai, about 200 bucks (I don't remember exactly, but it was around 200). I was shocked when the waiter came with a big serving of briyani. How big, you ask? Two people could share it easily. The taste was first class. I for one can handle briyani as much as you think, but I was stunned. It isn't the best briyani I've ever tasted, but its my first Hyderabadi Biryani and I loved it. Such a great experience."

But the staff was the sweetest.\nThere was this lady whose name I can't recall but she when I asked if I can get some gulab jamuns even after it was over, she made them especially for me and delivered on table.\nThat gesture made me like the restaurant better.\nPS.

The AC was non-existent. It felt like we were sitting in a tandoor. The service was pretty slow.  If you bring food you bring the starters together and then you don't put a gap in between the starters and the main course. The taste was appalling, sub-par service, being in one of the prime locations. I have ordered a lot of times from Kritunga Madhapur and that one is very good.

            "This was place was a surprise as it is better than you imagine. Though it turned out to be a bit hot, the air circulation could have been better. The food and drinks were as how they were described. Must try.",
            "The Glass Onion is located at a calm and a quiet place. Despite being around a km behind Infosys, the place gives it an advantage of switching away from city chaos and you needn't be bothered about finding a place for parking. While the restaurant does offer valet, but the parking area next to the restaurant is huge and you can easily get a place there.\n\nOnce you enter the restaurant you're floored by the grandness of the place as it comes as something unexpected. They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Owing to the summers, we opted for indoor seating. The tables are well spaced and there's enough distance between the adjacent tables to give you a premium experience.\n\nThe servers are well groomed, attentive and make good recommendations basis the specialities of the restaurant and after checking your preference. For starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti Kebab and Nachos. The Kebabs were well cooked and though a little spicy left a good after taste. The Nachos were light, crispy and had good amount of toppings. Despite Nachos being one of the common starters, I'd still recommend people to try the ones here.\n\nFor the main course we ordered the Lahori Paneer Combo that gets served with a small bowl of Dal Makhni and Naan/Pulao. The Paneer too tasted very good and had the right amount of spices which blended well with the Paneer. The Dal Makhni that came along with the Paneer was out of this world. It's a pity that it doesn't get served separately, but upon request the servers certainly obliged by offering another small bowl of the same. For something that's prepared so well, I feel that the patrons should get to taste more of it and would request the management of the restaurant to include it in their menu.\n\nFinally the dessert. Tiramisu pastry. Simply no words. Right amount of sweetness, well blended flavour and that smooth after taste of coffee. After a good dinner, the Tiramisu sealed the deal for us to be one completely satisfied customers.\n\nOne small observation that I'd still like to add is that despite a good number of servers, they tend to get distracted and slightly inefficient when all the tables start getting full. Towards the end we had to remind them about the dessert and it was evident that they had missed bringing it. However considering that they were attentive and friendly for most of our time there, I wouldn't penalize the restaurant with a star but would request to keep a check on the observation and continue to maintain the quality of the food to keep ensuring repeat visits.",

Its just amazing.\nThe food was also great. Something that good be improved is the customer service. There is a bit of delay in getting the orders.\nTop Picks :\n- Mint Cooler\n- Chicken BBQ Pizza\n\nThe ambience will offset the price you pay. Overall, a must visit place.",
            "This place looks really nice with some good music. They have both outdoor and indoor seating facility and it's a best place to hangout with the family and friends. Outdoor seating has an amazing view of the Golf ground and can be enjoyed during evening.\n\nThey welcomed us with a welcome drink which was really nice.\nFirst we ordered Screw Driver, Tropical Delight and Mint Cooler which was really good.\n\nScrew Driver - It was a Cocktail which contains Vodka and Orange juice.\n\nTropical Delight - It had Orange, Pineapple, Mango and cream which taste differently. I personally liked that blend but my friends didn't. I would rate 3.8/5.\n\nMint Cooler - It is just normal Virgin Mojito what we gets in other places as well. Nothing special was not their. 3.5/5\n\nFor Starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti which was ok ok. The kulcha was bit hard so that we need to chew it more. 3.4/5\n\nNext we ordered BBQ Roasted Chicken pizza which was good. The pizza was properly cooked but bit burned at the end which can happen. But that was covered by the taste. 4/5\n\nOverall the experience was really good and it is located in a calm area where we can sit and enjoy with our kids or family or friends.\n\nOverall - 4.6/5",
            "The place was in a very high end location. The ambience was not up to the mark. The service seemed pretty hostile when we asked them basic questions. And when we asked them to pack some of the remaining food, they didn't seem too happy about it. The appetizers and soup were good, but the quantity was too little. We ordered the \"Classic Mezeh Platter\" and when asked for some pita bread, the waiters frowned upon us and did not give us an appropriate response. Overall the place is overpriced and the service needs to be improved.",

We went with office colleagues on a celebration treat.\n\nAmbience was really good. We had experience of both indoor and outdoor dining. Outdoor dining truly outscored indoor experience.\n\nFood was good but a bit higher on the price looking at portion size. We ordered Mediterranean platter, Bruschetta for vegetarians. The mocktails were nice.\n\nIt was couple of days before elections and apparently alcohol was not to be served. What really impressed me was that they followed rules. That's really good to see.\n\nFor main course we ordered a north indian combo, a very customised pasta and couple more things. They tasted good.

The rain today made it even better. Outdoor has this chil lounge vibe with good house music and indoor being this good energy family or dinner vibe.\n\nThats it to the place and good part!\n\nService was bad, food was ok. If a restaurant does not serve filter water it is a huge problem. Buying water is a choice not force. Doesn\u2019t matter if you are local udipi or a five star. We were told we dont have filter water something is broken so you buy. While leaving we did see other tables served normal water.\n\nWe did have zomato gold to use, but the experience was not so great to use it. First turnoff , dont have kingfisher beers.\n\nWe ordered veg tandoor platter, margherita pizza , tiramisu and cheesecake.\n\nPizza was the best part and yet i would say a 3.5/5. Generous amount of sauce and cheese but 3 basil leaf to count. We asked for mustard and denied.\n\nThe platter had many things but of of which was paneer tikka n no grilled onion or peppers or tomato. Whole platter didnt come with any onion et al side. Extra chutney took forever to come.\n\nTiramisu was average will not try again or recommend\n\nCheesecake was pretty bad. Packed to throw i guess. The blueberry on it ...is red color which is super confusing. The creamcheese itself i would guess will be cheaper kind making it hard.\n\nThey gave a birthday brownie, Which frankly was average too. However, the server comes and tells me during payment, i have not charged you for brownie. WTF!!!!!\n\nOverall i will recommend to go to njoy the place and have few drinks.

Lotus stem galouti kabab- mildly spiced, well cooked and melts in the mouth. Ordered Chettinad chicken Indian tray. It was amazing! Sundried tomatoes chicken pasta was made perfectly.

            "I went there with my office colleagues. The ambience is good. The music played is little loud, may be volume can be reduced a bit so that we do not need to about while speaking.\n\nAbout food, quality of food is good, but waiters need to be taught that when four people order two different dishes, all those to be served at same time. What happens was, we two finished out veg food and the nob veg waa not even delivered when we finished our veg food.\n\nWe ordered Lotus stem Galouti, the taste of Galouti was good, but keeping one small kulcha was not going well. I know it must be an experiment, but I guess it is not working out as it was not going well with Galouti.\n\nSo, overall, good for one time."

They changed their menu and the new taste is not worth it.",

Mushroom soup was very nice too.... minestrone was average.... Couldn't try the desserts because there's only so much a person can have lol...\n\nP.S. - they do have a bar but no Bira.\n\nService - polite. But you must be patient. Food preparation takes time. If you reach post 9:30pm, you will be expected to order your entire meal in one shot itself.\n\nVFM - it's an expensive bistro but the chef deserves it. He's absolutely spot on with the flavours.

Few of them even had the spiral binding missing in places.\nThe chairs and table cloth evinced that the restaurant was not very well maintained.\n\nComing to the food, I can say that it was very disappointing.

Also, the wings were glazed in two different sauces though they both tasted the same - Sweet and heavy.\n\u25aa\ufe0eThe red sauce of the pasta was diluted .It was done to such an extent that the sauce was not willing stay with the penne pasta.\n\u25aa\ufe0eThe pizza was the first relief, though it wasn't as it as some of the other restaurants. It was thin and it retained its shape.\n\u25aa\ufe0eThe tiramisu was a disaster. The cream was spoilt and the whole desert tasted sour. We had to send it back.\n\nFinally, the service. The service was one of the very few worthwhile experience.\n\nAll in all, I will not visit this restaurant again and a do not recommend it to anyone.",

We availed zomato gold offer but as we did not inform them before placing the order, initially they were very reluctant to accept as we need to inform them well in advance before placing the order. The restaurant manager was very understanding and generated a second bill, though he will be questioned by the owner he took that extra mile just for providinding customer satisfaction. I will definitely suggest this restaurant not only in terms of food but also in terms of their polite and customer oriented generosity. Thank you frio for making our visit splendid.",

The onion samosa takes me back to my childhood days when we used to buy them at small shops for a rupee or so. They tasted amazing here. I wouldn't recommend getting the chai ir samosa delivered at all. Kills the taste completely. These needs to be had hot and getting it delivered will definitely disappoint.\n\nTalking about the fries, i wouldn't say they were amazing but they sure weren't bad.

It is also pretty easy to locate.\n\nThe items we ordered were Barbeque Mushroom Sandwich, Spaghetti in Alfredo sauce with Vegetables, Apple Pie with Vanilla Ice cream, Irani Chai and Filter Kapi. Apart from the apple pie, all the items were really tasty. The pie's crust was a bit too thick. Rest, everything was worth every single penny. I would love to visit this place again.\n\nQuantity: 4.5/5\n\nValue for money: 4.5/5\n\nI also happened to order their Exotic Vegetable Pizza through Zomato. I found the price quite reasonable. The best part was the sauce with a desi twist.\n\nKarachi Caf\u00e9, with a variety of food and beverage items and an amazing ambience, is a really cool place to hangout.",

Today I went here and it even exceeded that other cafe today in terms of pure pathetic-ness of the cafe. The service is so rude, slow and pathetic that you wonder how bad would it be to make it self service. The food is bad and certainly not worth such high prices. And the guys are least bothered to tell you by the time that you ask for bill that one of the drinks you ordered isn't available; let alone bring drinks along with the food. I don't know how these inflated ratings in Hyderabad is working, but in my hometown, a place like this would hardly touch 2 stars rating on zomato.",
            "I really wish i could finish off the review in a word, but yeah, zomato is not letting me to that! If you guys want to have irani chai, i guess this is the place. And omg, that onion samosa? Before getting there, do you guys remember the small triangle shaped samosa we would all go ga-ga for? Yes. They have it! You don't need to go street to street searching for them. They have it right here. So one plate samosa, irani chai and osmania biscuits. You hit cloud nine! Oh i forgot, this is for you guys! To the guys who are living alone far away from your own home without your mamma and pappa, you'd definitely wanna hit this place listening to 'mere sapno ke rani kab..'. yea. Only Kishore Kumar ! And the place. Let's just say, it's all VINTAGE!\nAmbience, food chai, music, cleanliness- 5/5 \u2764\ufe0f",

            "This restaurant deserves a special mention for their superbly amazing Keema Pav!! I usually do not eat mutton dishes in restaurants (I prefer home-made), but the Keema Pav served here reminded me of home - it's that good! We had even ordered for Baida Roti - which was again too good and had a very interesting take to it. (By the way, their servings are quite big compared to what they charge you for!) Suleimaani Chaai also deserves a special mention, it was so good that we ordered it twice.\nThe ambience is also so good! They had these old ad posters put up on their walls - it really reminded me of those old Parsi restaurants in Mumbai.",
            "Love the ambience, has a rustic feel to it. I recommend the chai and their baked goods. The service is good and everything is reasonably priced.",
            "The ambience literally brings you the vintage feels. The service of this place is brilliant.\nWhen I visited this place firstly I had ordered for some bun maska and Sulaimani chai, really liked it. I also had the chicken kabiraji, personally I felt it could have been slightly better."

Once we reached, the bouncer refused us entry saying stags are not allowed on dance floor. I called manager again he also denied entry. I can't understand why can't they clarify the same on call.

The food is the shittiest thing ever made and eaten in human history. The waiters are rude and incompetent to either understand hindi or English. The acoustics in the karaoke nights sucks. When we asked for a manger, three different waiters came to us and finally when we said we won't pay the bill until the manager addresses our concerns is when the amazing pot bellied, arrogant and rude manager showed up. His name is Ali and he was in no mood to listen to any of the feedback we provided instead he offered as 2 free drinks which we definitely didn't need because somewhere he already agreed with the feedback we gave but he didn't want to do anything about it. When I tried explaining him that we would pay the bill, add tip and don't want free drinks but we want him to take the feedback seriously, he was like \"if u r leaving, leave, why are u wasting my time?\" I lost it and I was telling my friend, I repeat, I was talking to my friend stating \"what the fuck is wrong with this place\" is when he interrupts me and says that I need to mind my language. I was like, WHAT? \"I\" am talking to \"my friend\" about the \"place\" What's your problem in that? And I literally said sorry even, joined my hands for forgiveness to which he replies staying \"ye badtameez ladkia yaha aati he kyu hai, tmko jo karna hai karlo, ladkiya he ho na, kya ukhaadlogi, UKHAAD lo.\" So that pretty much defines this place, the food and the people. Don't be a fool to visit this place even after reading my review. But yeah, if u think u can reach Ali a nice lesson, please go ahead, all my blessings are with you \ud83d\ude0b",

Me being eggatarian, obvious i ordered for an Egg Biryani. What presentation and what taste. Usually you just get the egg booked on top of the rice, but here, they cut it and the spice is inside of the cut Egg. How cool and tasty. I did have some before like this but this, this taste. Yummmmm. Kudos!\n\nHowever they have done complimentary sweet for everyone the day I went there. That wasn't all that good. Way to sweet. Uhh. And my friend is a Non-vegetarian, he had some chicken Biryani and sure he licked his fingers. Awesome Ulavacharu. I'm coming back soon. Thank-you.",

            "We went to the first floor confused whether to go to Shanghai Chef or Kobe's, later to realise they are in the same restaurant (i.e they share floor space). We decided to order Chinese. We had the DimSum platter (3/5), Kung Pao Chicken (2/5), Dragon Prawns (2/5) and Fried Ice Cream (4/5). The chicken was hard inside (not indicative of fresh chicken), the prawns were sweet and the DimSums had thick coatings. I did not enjoy my time at Shanghai Chef. So maybe when you're there, just try the Sizzler. Ill update my review when I have it.\nKobe's is a really famous chain for Sizzlers.",
            "They have a wide range of food offering. Nothing much to talk about ambiance. I visited this place 2 times in a week. 1st time ordered a sizzler which was fantastic.  2nd time we had a chicken stater, soup and a american chopsuey. Soup and starter was good but sea food American Chopsuey was not good. Being a person from coastal area I can tell if sea food is fresh or not, and boy, the prawns were not fresh that is for sure. All and all its a causal dinning if you crave for some variety of Asian food.",
            "Stale food and indigestible noodles. Please don't visit here if you don't want to fall sick. The chicken was dry and uncooked , the noodles was sticky and under cooked. Felt the items were reheated as it was served way quicker than expected.",

            "Location wise it is placed in a prime location, centre of IT area, Gachibowli. Food was so delicious, only if you like Chinese flavor, else don't visit. Interior ambience was not so cool, very ordinary. Different kind of soups and dimsums are available at reasonable prices.\nGreat place to hangout, but if you are planning to visit in weekend then prebooking is recommended.",
            "Really loved the food.Tried new Chinese things.Would definitely recommend this.The service was a little slow,but the taste compensated for it.A must visit if you love typical Chinese food.",

            "I've been to Shanghai Chef 2 quite a few times now. Twice before Kobe Sizzlers moved in and once after. It has great staff and a wonderful ambience. It gets busy over the weekend and you might have to reserve a table beforehand. Their sizzlers are wonderful and they have a great set of starters. I would suggest you try them over the main course.",
            "Service was pathetic and staff was absolutely rude and not open for feedback. service is one area where management has to focus on at least as per my experience. Definitely not a place that I will ever visit again with the kind of experience, not that there was any argument or anything it was very cold.",

Service is good.\n\nIt's definitely worth the money we pay.",

            "If it hadn\u2019t been for my friend this place would have simple gone unnoticed. Your typical road side eatery and must have breakfast destinations. The pipping hot vadas are the best I\u2019ve had. Restricted myself to just one vada so that I could try other items. Butter steamed dosa and karampudi idli were good too. Visited this place on both the days for breakfast during my 2-day visit to Hyderabad.",
            "Not up to mark as per it\u2019s brand name.\n\n\nFood is just like ordinary tiffin centre\u2019s\n\nNeed to improve and provide food really authentic of Udipi\nAmbiance is really awkward no cleanliness even in Ac family section also",

            "One of the best places to have South Indian tiffin varieties in Gachibowli area.  Most cost effective and tasty, quick fast food on offer. I enjoyed the food here and have tried out many times and on almost daily too.  If anyone have any doubt, the crowd that is present here almost all of the time should indicate the popularity of the joint here. \n\nSituated in a busy area on the Gachibowli main road near to the ORR inter-junction. You cannot miss the place. I have tried out their meals, tiffin varieties, the bhajji & pakodas in the evening and also their tea. Have been satisfied with all of it and do not have any complaints. \n\nAbsolutely zero ambiance and its self service too. Be prepared for the rush and once you get the token, be prepared to be squeezed in a corner to give out your token to the waiters inside. There is no queue system here and they just collect your tokens at random.  When your food item is ready, they spot you and give it to you. Be prepared for some hassles out here as you get jostled around. Finding a spot to eat your food during rush hour is also a problem. There are a couple of tables to sit but majority of the others stand at the tables and eat. Just eat your food quick and rush out. \n\nMy fav of theirs is the Dosa. I just loved the Chutney and the sambar taste even though it was a bit sweeter to my taste. Also loved the Kerala Parotta which is a fav dish of mine back home here in Chennai.",

The sambar was sweeter than I expected. I believe it is the Karnataka style. I still liked it. The Bonda was awesome and the price was comparatively low. Great experience. I would like it if they had spicier sambar.",
            "No frills place. Many families frequent this restaurant. There is air conditioned seating area below. Don't expect great service, but the service will be quick. Prices reasonable. Pineapple kesari and parota kurma are must have.",
            "If you are looking for a good South Indian breakfast, then this place is a must-go. Prices is rather higher than any usual shop, but the quality would make worth spending that money.\n\nGood variety. Good taste. Decent staff. Have options for chat, tea,coffee stall as well",
            "Nice place for budget outing. Generally taste of all items is good and very reasonable. Regular place of visit of us when in hurry, Quick service. Good parcel option for quick takeaways. South Indian food is better here compared to North Indian food. Juice and Tea counter outside helps.",

            "I was here with my dad for a quick tiffin/ snack time on our way home. Frankly speaking, I wasn't expecting such good food. We had Masala Dosa, Idli and Vada. I felt there could have been a better variety of chutneys (like tamarind or ginger) apart from the regular coconut one. Not only did the food make us feel satiated, but also satisfied."

            "Tried this place after a long time. The order was just a south indian thali, peas pulav, Mixed subzi chatpata and a Strawberry milkshake.\nArrived at the restaurant by 2.15 on a sunday afternoon. After a full 40 mins the first dish to be served was milkshake!! Will a restaurant serve side drink / dessert first, when the main course is yet to be served?\n\nService 1/5 - you will see waiters only while ordering the food, once the order is taken you wont even see them coming to your table even to serve water. You will see them standing in one corner of the restaurant, few walking in and out of the kitchen as if they are very busy. But no one will respond when you raise your hand/ or call for them. I literally had ti walk to them and ask for water.\n\nAmbiance 1/5 -\nSome kind of strange smell comes similar to the one you get in a dumped wet cloths\nIn short a worthless place.\n\nFood quality and taste 1/5.\nComing to the quality of food - the peas pulav had just peas in them i hardly found rice!.\nVery salty mixed subzi chatpata dish which just had onions and capsicum.\nAs mentioned before the food was served after 40 mins. The south indian thali had a sambar - it was a hot water in which dhal was washed and rasam was just hot water; when requested for a refill of bindi (it was the only dish that was nice), I was told that the dish got over unfortunately due to the time. I seriously wonder what took them 40 mins to serve, I have never had such a bad experience before in any restaurant of this level.\n\nValue for money - 0.5/5\n\nFor these so called high quality dishes I had to pay around 900. In short i will not suggest this place at all.",

            "I found this place pathetic. Went yesterday, most of the dishes we ordered were not available. The excuse waiter gave was that one of the chefs is on leave. I wonder if business stops for them if one the chef is not available.\nI read on zomato reviews that their thali is good. And restaurant's menu on zomato mentioned that thali is available in dinner as well, but on reaching restaurant I found out they are not serving thali in dinner now. I travelled 9km to visit this restaurant.\n\nFood was pathetic as well. Tanduri roti that we ordered was made of maida. And the dishes were either too oily or just bad.\n\nOverall this place is very bad and doesn't deserve a visit at all. There are plenty of restaurants all around Hyderabad which are much better than this for half the rate.\n\nAvoid this restaurant at all cost !!!",
            "I visited the place yesterday for lunch with my family. This is usually a most loved place by all my family members and me for a casual dining. But yesterday it is a very bad experience we noticed the manger is changed. It took 20 minutes to find some one to take the order. Then it took him almost 30 minutes for the thali. I called the manager and asked why is it taking so long as we habe only asked a thali and lassi. Then he told us that some of the food got over so we are preparing it again so only it is taking so much time. But is was courtesy that he could have informed us that it is going to take time. After 40 minutes the food was served. But the lassi again took a very long time we cancelled the order and moved out.",

The ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off.

But with such good starter I had pinned my hopes on Patiala lassi. But that was an anti climax of sorts. They used essence for the lassi.

However, the chicken starters were lil salty.\n\nService needs a lot of improvement.

My wife and I were struggling with the food.

Both the kebabs were juicy and succulent with individual distinct flavors in each of them. I really like it when one kebab doesnt taste like the other and each has its own unique flavor. While the homeminister like the less spicy and creamy flavor of the chicken malai kebab, I preferred the tangyness of the hara mirchi kebab.\n\nAlthough a bit on the pricier side, given the flavors and the taste, I am definitely waiting for a chance to order their biryani because if the kebabs are to go by anything, the biryani would definitely be flavorsome. \n\nFood - 5/5\nValue for Money - 4/5",

            "Just the name of Biryani and Hyderabadis get hunger pangs! And so did we when we heard about Biryanis and more at Gachibowli for a food tasting session! Biryanis and more is a popular name in the food industry with its branches in USA as well, they are trying to spread the love for biryani across the globe with their lipsmacking varieties of biryani! And after a a few outlets in Hyderabad the newest was opened in Gachibowli opposite to Nissan Showroom or opposite to Biodiversity complex! The place is very easy to locate! Though a small outlet but yet incredible! Simple interiors with the place efficiently used for the seating! The staff was really friendly and attentive and a special mention to a staff member Sudhir who took good care of us right from the moment we entered to the time we left! \u270c\ud83c\udffb We being completely unaware of the menu thought that this place would be just about Biryanis...but to Our surprise this place serves variety of other dishes which are really appetizing! We started off with the shakes, we were served the Mango Lassi, Ginger cola, Ginger lemon, Sparkling blue and Virgin Mojito! And all of them were soo refreshing specially the sparkling blue and the ginger cola! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb Next we had the soups, we were served the lemon coriander soup and the chicken manchow soup! They were good! And next came the starters and we had the Apollo fish, Chilli prawns, Tender chicken, Bangla Kodi, Corn 65, and Crispy veg! The best and the must have dish among them was the TENDER CHICKEN! The chicken pieces were really fleshy and juicy which were well marinated and fried with breadcrumbs! It was both Tender and crispy at the same time! Really enjoyed this dish! And the Bangla Kodi, a dish which was very new to us! It was something very unique tasty and spicy! It is made with baked potatoes with chicken filling and then it is deeply fried! You definitely should try this if you haven't! Crispy veg made with the flour batter mixed with different veggies like onion carrots etc tasted yumm! And corn 65 was amazing! Soo delectable and tasty and a completely different kind of experience for a person who have always had chicken 65! \ud83d\ude02The sea food was a little here and there.. Prawns were a little salty and the fish wasn't cooked really well...soo there's a room for improvement when it comes to the sea food! But they have covered it all up with their DELICIOUS BIRYANIS!\ud83d\ude0d A complete delight to your eyes and to your taste buds as well! We had the Ulavacharu Chicken Biryani, Chicken Avakai Biryani and Chicken Afghani Biryani! Totally totally worth the money and just the Best \u2764 Ulavacharu biryani made of the spices from Horse gram has that khatta meetha taste in it making it soo soo damn awesome! It is said that Ulavacharu gives heat to your body soo don't forget to have some curd, yoghurt or the raita to make it even! And then there was this Chicken Avakai Biryani, yet another mindblowing taste! Avakai means Mango..and this Biryani is made from the spices of Mango...it had the taste of the mango pickle! Never had we imagined that we'd ever be eating chicken biryani with the taste of Mango pickle! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d Then came the Afghani biryani...it's just the opposite of Ulavacharu and Avakai when it comes to the spicy level! Really flavourful and palatable biryani served with an omelette on top! Believe us if you're a Biryani lover then this place should be definitely be in Your list! I'm gonna go back again for the Biryani! \u2764 the other main course included Naan basket with Chicken tikka masala and Chicken chettinadu!

And here at biryanis and more they have kept up with that level of spicy-ness and also the Taste! Soo the main course here is the real stunner! Next we had the desserts...ever wished to be Ganesh Gaitonde? \ud83d\ude02 You definitely do not want that life! But yes You can enjoy the same dessert which he just LOVES! The Kharvas also called as Junnu is an Indian milk pudding and it is made from the colostrum of the cow! We don't know how the actual taste of the Junnu is as we never had it before but yes here at biryanis and more the taste was Superb! \ud83d\ude0d You ought to have this dessert to get that Gaitonde feels! Next in line were the Gulab Jamun and Qubani ka meetha, the presentation of the desserts isn't really appealing soo the hotel management should definitely look after that and make some changes but the taste was good! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\nSoo if You love to enjoy a variety in Biryani then Biryanis and more should be Your next stop! \ud83d\ude0d You're going to love it",

The staff is exceptionally attentive and a special shout out to Mr. Sudhir for completely taking care us and treating us with an excellent dinner.\n\nAs soon as we sat down, we were greeted enthusiastically with mocktails. A group of six food enthusiasts promptly ordered six diverse mocktails namely Sparking blue, Mango lassi, Ginger cola, Ginger lemons, Virgin mojito, Masala cola. Out of all the mocktails, Masala cola and mango Lassi stood out and were the best. The other mocktails were equally good and refreshing.\n\nDelicious appetizers:\n\nCrispy Veg: A variety of vegetables deep fried and garnished with aromatic flavors was something that wasn\u2019t new that we didn't have, but it tasted excellent!\n\nCorn 65: It tasted absolutely delicious. Corn balls deep fried and then garnished with mayo to give the 65 feel! Thoroughly recommended.\n\nBangla Kodi: Which was a signature dish of the restaurant, but for us it was a dish that also stood apart.\n\nChilli prawns: Spicy, stirred fried, It tasted awesome.\n\nTender chicken: The star of the appetizers. Brest chicken fillets dipped and fried with bread crumb batter. Highly recommended, please don't miss out on this dish.\n\nApollo fish: So it was a fish.

I was shocked when I received a message from traffic police about challan which was issued on 15th Apr 2019 for traffic violation. In fact, it is very impractical, and owner should educate to security not to provide any wrong information. If restaurant does not have valet parking, then the customer has the responsibility to park her or his car.\n\nWith situation, I have no choice so I have paid the amount of challan, but would like to share my experience for awareness to others so individual can take care while parking their car based on valet parking.\n\nReally, I am very upset with this type of irresponsible behavior.

I couldn't believe when the food turn out to look the same it looked in pictures upload by them.\nI ordered Gobi chilli and tossed noodles combo(medium) together with one gobi chilli extra.\nVeggies overloaded in noodles and the sweet,sour and spicy flavor in gobi chilli was astounding. It's been 2years in Gachibowli and this turned out to be the best chilli and noodles I have ever had here. The garlic aroma in gobi chilli and the sourness was remarkable.\nMedium combo is best for a hungry adult. I don't know about mini combo as I didn't order it.\nHighly recommended place.",

Not one whole egg, so that I can at least remove it (I am not repulsed by egg, chicken would have been a different story, of course!) But this was bits and pieces mixed in the rice and gravy. No way to remove them.\n\nI would recommend this place to non vegetarians. Order veg and get non veg for the price of veg!\n\nVegetarians beware!!!\n\nI have just added the initial pic with the big piece, the rest small pieces in the rice, I did not have the patience to click or pick.\nNever ordering from here ever again!"

The bread tasted fresh and the sourness was accentuating the flavors. Served with crispy potato wedges and a coleslaw, the whole meal is quite filling.\n\nThe very cheesy panini was prepared with wholewheat bread and had a distinct cheese flavor to it. It could have worked with a little more spice but that doesnt meant the flavors were any less. \n\nBoth the sandwiches were gulped down with the iced latte served in a tall glass.\n\nService was quick and the ambiance was pleasant with good music on play. \n\nAlthought a bit on the pricier side, the menu offers a lot of variety and the place is recommended for their signature sandwiches prepared with their home baked bread.\n\nAmbiance - 5/5\nService - 5/5\nFood - 4/5\nValue for Money - 4/5",

But today I wished to have the traditional Fish & Chips served in English and Irish pubs in the UK and America.  Theirs is Batter Dipped unlike other (sometimes more expensive) places - and when one adds vinegar and salt to the fish in lieu of the tartar sauce provided (this is really hard  to get right in India in any case)- the result was a delicious facsimile.",

Plus great Hygiene condition maintained by the kitchen staff.I have been here for breakfast and had English paneer tikka sandwich and iced latte.

For vegans, they had just 2 starters.. the food did not had any taste, it was more like just things being mixed without any skills. Desserts were little better, but main course was completely disappointing, be it the dal makhani, which lacked consistency, or the paneer, which was like cubes poured on top of the gravy. I certainly would have tasted better food than this at pretty lower costs.",

I tried the A-la-carte menu as well as the Buffet here and loved every bit of the food that was served. Chef Chinmay Panda, Chef Abhay Kumar Sahoo and Ms Hema were the perfect hosts every time! There was an instance when the Chef inquired about our food preferences and specially prepared French Toast and mind blowing Idiappam for us! Once they knew that we were checking out from the hotel that day, they specially got us a pastry with the words 'Bon Voyage' engraved in chocolate on the serving dish.

It has an option of gelato and avalanche for the base and I have choosen gelato.\n\nMust try : Premium forest berry shake, caramel brownie shake, Peri Peri fries.\n\nThe shakes are super yummy and I had my best shakes here. I will definitely try some more shakes.",

There were so many dead flies and insects on the tables which would bring disgust.\n\nService-(4/5) They know their work, prepare the shakes well. One suggestion is to provide water to the customers, as it seems ridiculous that you deny with the fact that you guys don't have water.\nWonder what u add in Shakes!!",

The shakes are categorized into premium and classic and each category has lots of flavors to choose from and the taste is amazing. They have all flavors of premium chocolates like lindt, toblerone to local chocolates of India. The containers that shakes are given in could have been of better quality.\nThere are only two snack items available French Fries and Potato wedges and I feel being such a franchise they should have added more options. But the variety of toppings given makes good sense.\nOverall, I liked the quality of milk shakes.",

I don't know if it's their speciality to serve sweet burgers, but I didn't liked it a bit. It was my 1st burger order from K s bakes and I would not recommend anyone to order burgers from there.

My favourites are bournvita cookies and pastries and also choco almond pastery. I would personally feel that their fast food or snacks could be improved in taste and the way it is served. Also I personally do not like it self service scheme here. This does not mske you feel privileged as you feel when you are entering the shop. Also, its announcement system is too bad. Makes you feel like on a railway station. Hence stars cut as these are part of ambience.\n\nOverall the products are good and one can always try them. Prices are midway and therefore acceptable.",

It offers good food at relatively low prices. The place is never too crowded, so one can always manage to find a seat on the first floor.\n\nI had their Chicken pizza, chocolate milkshake, red velvet pastry and all varieties of their chicken burgers, not one is disappointing. All the items taste good. I might specially praise their chicken cheese burger because that is my all time favorite.\nThey have to improve in the milkshakes department.",

            "I went to this place for lunch with my mom and dad. The ambience is quite decent, with a lot of seating places. We ordered chicken coriander soup, golden fried prawns, a mixed fried rice and a plate of dry chilly chicken. Golden fried prawns were a bit plain, it could have been more flavourful. The soup was good. Fried rice and chily chicken were good in taste. All costed us around Rs. 1400. It was a light and good meal. I'd like to revisit this place again.",

The food was okayish but we are thankful they didn't kick us out while we were eating.\n\nIn short, horrible service.",

I got flat 50% offer from Dine out \"that's exciting\"..\n\nFirst thing to try was Chicken Tom Yum soup.. ohh it was one good tasting soup I had for a while. And then from nowhere we ordered butter garlic prawn.. it surprised me as well.. never seen this in a Chinese restaurant and to no surprise it was HORRIBLE.. battered fried butter garlic prawn with no hint of butter anywhere.. with my experience I would call it a piece of &#-+.. it was all crapy.. and when I asked I got the reply that the Chinese chef has changed... And they replaced the item with chilly garlic prawn.. it was ok for my liking..\n\nNow we have ordered\n\n Chicken drumsticks\n\nShezwan chicken dimsums\n\nSingapore noodles mix\n\nChinese chopsuey\n\nYang Chow Rice\n\nSchezwan Chicken\n\nTo sum up the best item was chicken drumsticks. \n\nDimsums where stale and the outer coating was all soggy.\n\nSingapore noodles was more vermicelli than noodles.\n\nYan chow rice was good\n\nSo was Schezwan chicken.\n\nExperience was decent I would say specially with the offer I got.. flat 50% off.\n\nA loud shout out to the dine out team ..\n\nI would wish to come again if I get such offer .. but a friendly suggestion to the restaurant.. please try and make some change as we have very less Chinese restaurant nearby.. \n\nThanks",

            "This place is located in khajaguda. It used to be one of my favorite places because of the taste, quantity and pricing. I used to visit this place every weekend or in fact twice a week.\n\nFood is no doubt good..their soups, starters dal makhani, etc.. However there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden.\n\nPrices have been almost doubled . I used to have a dal makhani at 180 rs and now its priced at 300 rs.. I believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost 50% is really a good decision with no changes in ambience. ? I believe their main USP was good food at affordable prices at a decent ambience.. Even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and Moti Mahal have lower prices and better ambience..\n\nWith hike in prices, customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience, fancy cutlery on the table .. well decorated tables , and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use, well dressed waiters.. etc..\n\nHope the management would rethink..",
            "This review was long due. Located on the Khajaguda Road this restaurant claims to be part of the Gachibowli cluster and when I asked the owner he said he was just on the edge of Gachibowli and, therefore, technically they are in Gachibowli. The place has good parking and nice natural setup which has still been maintained despite the recent road construction.\n\nComing to the food we went for the Gulaabi Chaap after checking on Google, unfortunately this is the only place in India that offers this dish and we had no clue about the dish until we got it. Simply put it was amazing, mild rose smelling chicken cooked in the tandoor and served with mint sauce. It gave a heavenly feeling. Next on the list was the Chicken Momo which was soft and fresh again reminded me of some amazing momos I had in Manali. I hope some day they make Mutton Momos as well.\n\nButter Chicken was by far the best in town which went very well with another amazing bread called the Malai Warki Paratha. It was soft and was melting in the mouth with the Butter Chicken. Seemed like a match made in heaven. Much said about the main course we went for their version of Special Biryani. As is known from my reviews I don't eat too spicy food and this was just the perfect spicy level one could ask for. It had boneless pieces of chicken pan fried and served on top of the Biryani Rice. The taste was good and to my liking. Our Vegetarians friends were enjoying their Daal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala which was again good and their Veg Biryani as per them was equally good.\n\nThanks to the friendly staff we went on eating for close to 2 and half hours without feeling the time passing by. The large projector added to the aura of the place and we enjoyed the IPL on the large screen. They offered us a 20% discount and another 10% on our next visit apparently one of their limited time running offer. Thank you aromas@11six for being such a good host and an amazing food. We shall be back again.",

            "I have been ordering from this place for a long time. They are fantastic in terms of following any specific instructions you might have when you order via Swiggy or UberEats. The food is as described, there is no overdose of spices or oil. The menu is varied. I have tried Chinese and Tandoori dishes from here, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. This is my first choice when we want to dine in. My favourite dishes from here are Chicken Lababdaar, Kafuli and Chicken Afghani.\n\nI took away one star from the review as there are rare issues with quality control, like tandoori kababs were once a little burnt."

            "The most important factor which I take into consideration is- Service.\nAnd if they are rude, don't give any importance to customers, they don't deserve anything.\nGiving 2 stars just for the ambience",
            "Mandi is good. Prices are affordable with generous serving. We tried fish Mandi and it was yummy. Only thing they need to fix is furniture as it looks worn out.",
            "Best place for all mandi fans. Nevwr miss their saalan and miyo and with no forgetting their extra fried onions. It is best for giving treats. Budget friendly parties",
            "Have been here once. The staff was courteous and very friendly. Overall the theme was perfect and sets the Arabic mood. I think they can work a bit more on offering more choices, felt that the choices were limited apart from the mandi it is known for. Limited veg options too.",
            "Ordered grilled tandoori and to my surprise i have got 2 neck pieces for one chicken...must be an alien!!! Such a pathetic taste of food that i am never going to order from this joint again",
            "I just wonder how people praise the food and service.\nMaybe the day was different for me but I was really very dissapointed with the service they had given. We asked for raita and we were served after we almost finished our mandi. I hate such late servings.\nMandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great. Instead I find it better at other places.\n\nAmbience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants. However the choice of music could have been better.\n\nOverall I would say its just a waste to ur pocket and palate."

The starters tasted really good specially the cheese garlic bread & ghee idly.\n\nWe had enough dishes in the main course & there were mocktails being served whenever asked, Raspberry tasted the best.\n\nDeserts weren't that great. Vanilla scoops were just fine.\n\nOverall, It seemed like a great place to hang out with a large crowd & also alone (Yes, for those cricket maniacs, you can just get yourself a beer & relax).\n\nEither ways, it seemed at its best with proper space, lights, music & yaa, privacy.\n\nI would rate:\n\nTaste: 3.2/5 (veg buffet)\nAmbience: 4/5\nValue for money: 3/5",

Chicken white sauce pasta. Isse behtar pasta maine kahin nahi Khaaya! :)\n\n2) Must try all the brews! Very different and unique in taste.

It was steamed Fish and mixed with some green sauce. Taste was 5/5 .\n\nSubba\u2019s secret recipe noodles was gravy noodles with lots of veggies, mushroom, chicken.

The food is delicious, and there is the option for buffet and Alacarte, so we choose buffet which every thing they served on the table, which is really a good thing for me because I went with my parent.

The waiter handed us the \"Signature\" menu and that is when the ordeal began. Most of the signature dishes were unavailable. It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu. Eventually, we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650++. Overall a disappointing evening.",

            "Amongst the so many options now available for dining at Gachibowli, Urban Asia is difficult to ignore both for location and food. Getting in there if you are driving can be tricky sometimes since there is too much traffic in a narrow lane. However, they have a valet in the basement and you can park there and head over to the 4th floor which actually is a mix of a few restaurants. The place offers both buffet and a-la-carte options and you could choose what you like. We ordered Pad Thai noodle and chilly Tofu. I have not had such soft and delicious todu in a long time and was happy to have given that a shot. Moreover, the portion size was fairly decent. The Pad Thai tasted slightly sweet to my wife's liking but again flavoursome and good portion. The place was quiet and you could enjoy your food in peace. The staff is courteous and service is prompt.",

They we're serving what they deemed fit for us and not as per our order. Chicken lababdar was wanting in taste, fennel seeds were used and curry was as thin as a soup , no one was nearby when serving were required. Service is what we look forward to when dining in your restaurant.Either there was change in chef or some other temporary issues. Hope it would be fixed soon and we will not be disappointed when dining next time with our friends.",

            "We have been to Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar, Gachibowli. We ordered crisp noodles (shrimps) with sweet and sour sauce which was obviously a wrong choice. Crispy noodles is never a right choice (at least for me) wherever you go and sweet n sour soup with shrimps just made it worse. I am a seafood lover and the quantity and size of shrimps didn't justify its price. Next was Standing Pomfret dish in schezwan sauce...which turned out to be a disappointment. Who prepares pomfret in all-purpose flour? It was not good at all."

The AC was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside. The service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming. Starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good, the pace of refills needed to improve.\n\nI honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course. The stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that's about it.\n\nIt's expensive factoring in the food and service you get. These guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment. Could give it a try for the ambiance though.",

Serving is damn slow, even though not much of crowd in the restaurant. Price is pretty on a higher side, virgin mojito just tasted as mint lemon drink. We need to ask several times to serve, also when we for main course figured out that few dishes were not served to us which were part of starters, when asked, the same was brought later, Welcome Drink is the one which is served after several remainders and tasted bad. Desserts were not so great and not many. Felt with the cost that was paid this is not much upto mark. All in All pathetic service, you will literally ask 'n' number of times for food which is served on table. Not a wide range of dishes. Taste not so great especially with mock tails. Totally disappointed",
            "Beautiful ambience. The vintage look took me back to some good old days. The food was okay but they take quite some time to bring in the order. For instance, 30 min for a glass of Coke? We had been here for dinner and it took us a while to figure out that both urban Asia and Eat India company are together. The staff didn't attend us for a long time.

Ambiance is pretty authentic more like village and antique piece were drawing my attention....liked the quotes on pillars..\nIn starter, we ordered Kaju aur bhutte ki seekh which was too soft that break in small pieces.. Actually the consistency was not proper so could not take a bite properly.. Taste wise it was little bland so, there was only cashew taste I could feel..\nIn main course, we ordered Patiala Shahid paneer\nWhich was one of their signature dish which I was expecting to be good in taste..but again I disappointed with the taste it was normal onion tomato gravy and consistency of gravy was thin instead of creamy..Ajwain paratha and naan was good in taste\n\nMy experience was not so good..plus, staff members were not aware of anything regarding dish..",
            "Instagram | veganyums_\n\nEat India company has a sharing kitchen with urban kitchen. Interestingly, in eat India company, they also gave the urban kitchen's menu. Ambience is pretty good that has cobination of modern furniture and ancient India decorum.\n\nWhen we reach there, we asked waiter to suggest their best sellers in starters and main course. Very disappointed with the kind of knowledge they have about their dishes. They were not trained enough to speak confidently about the items mentioned in the menu.\n\nFinally, we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh in starter. The order arrived after 15 minutes. Plating looks good but tastewise, it was well below average. The stuffing was too dry, even with the chutney, it doesn't taste good.\n\nIn main course, we had patiala shahi paneer. Quantity was enough to serve two people, but again, don't expect the taste. Curry was too ordinary with lot of Curry leaves in it.\n\nAfter having such a horrifying experience, they included 5% tips for their waiters. Think before you visit this place. And in any circumstance, if you are visiting, beware of this waiter tip and you have right to remove it from your bill.",

We opted for a dinner buffet. The variety of items in the buffet were good. But starters were served cold on the table. This place is decently priced. I personally loved the Thai soup, chicken kabab, butter naan and dal.\nFood : 3.5/ 5\nAmbience : 4/5\nService :4/5"

We even took a box of fresh brownies which are awfully tasty.\n\nOnly lacking thing is this place doesn't support customization of cakes. Prices are a bit high but they are worth it as the taste is good.",

It was good in taste but nothing extraordinary and came with nice packing.\n\nOverall, you can try their cakes once although it may pinch your pocket.",

            "Okay so initially I thought it's quite expensive, especially for the brownies. But I had to try, of course. I took a risk of taking 2 boxes of assorted brownies for my friends. Well, in a nutshell, they loved it and so did I. Id not think twice about the brownies again! Cheers!",

The only negative is that they come in a box of around 15 pieces as the smallest offering.\n\nThe cupcakes are a delight as well, both red velvet and chocolate. Slightly high on the price point.\n\nAlways a go-to-place for an excellent experience! \u2764\ufe0f",

Although the staff is sweet and accommodating, the service is a little slow at times. Sometimes we have received our pizzas before the muffins. We highly recommend this place.

The order was taken over call and rest of the communication like what message is to be written on cake etc was done on whatsapp. When I called the next day to collect the cake, they could not find my order. I had to call multiple times and finally I was told my order is ready. Upon reaching the outlet, the message was not written on the cake and they hurriedly packed a cake and gave me. When I asked them if this is really mocha walnut, they said yes you can see the walnut on the cake. They even had no idea of how much payment is remaining or how much I have already paid. Upon reaching home when the cake was cut, we realised it is not mocha walnut but butterscotch!! The outlet cheated me and so I called them and blasted over phone. I reached the outlet at 10:30 pm at night and slammed the cake in the store and demanded my money back, I was paid back the amount but the experience was terrible and bitter specially because it was a b'day cake. The store management is pathetic and there is no coordination or even an ounce of professionalism in them. Never ever going back and I strictly recommend anyone to go at their own risk.

The same guy who was cleaning the tables brought us coffee bare hands, wish he\u2019d wear gloves. Hope the administration takes notice.",
            "Oh what a lovely place. Thanks to my friend who took me here for breakfast. Both of us were super hungry. We ordered mushroom omelette with butter crossiant and scarmbled egg with butter crossiant. A jalepeno bagel with cream chees. OMG \ud83d\ude32 what amazing they tasted. The best crossiant I have come across so far in India. So soft. So were the scrambles egg and mushroom omlette. The cream cheese was just amazing. We ordered Hazelnut cafe Mocha and Hazelnut capcuinno. They were just good. Thank go hazelnut syrup they used wasnt very sweet.\nI was so in love with smell of bread they are baking took. banana cake , Danish pastry , Chocolate cake and brioche for my frined. Would definitely recommend if you love bread that too freshly baked. \ud83d\ude0b",
            "Been here with my friends. Good place for meeting. Food is nice. Service is slow while ordering food. They can improve the outside restaurant because when I went AC was not working. Inside is very cool and  do your official work with full concentration. But its bit noisy due to machines inside. they can think about reducing the noise.",
            "Just your normal cafe, nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nVery slow and inattentive service. Okay food. Coffee not that great.\n\nThe only thing I would think of ordering on repeat would be the spinach and mushroom pie and maybe the blueberry Danish.\n\nValue for money could be better.\n\nNot at all inpressive :/",
            "A quiet and comfortable place for hanging out with friends. Their food is not that great but the service is good. We ordered simple dishes like Garlic bread, Pasta and Bagel.

Also had the grilled chicken sandwich with ginger pickle. That ginger taste was good. Overall good place to have some cakes and snacks.",
            "This place is located opposite to Deloitte towers, with the limited seating you will find it mostly over crowded. The ambiance has a vintage feel as soon as you enter.\nI ordered Paneer chilli pizza, peach iced tea,chilly cheese tpast and pink sauce pasta...all of them were okayish.\nPizza was perfect indian pizza, tasted like panner chilly gravy on pizza base and pasta also had a very Desi taste to it, they put carrots in pasta which didn't go well at all.I only like the chilly cheese toast which were toasted to perfection.\n\nPrice-3/5\nFood-3/5\nService-3/5\nAmbiance-3/5",

            "Taste is good - best things to order : Banana bread ( I can eat it whole day super yum!!!!!!), muffins, pesto pasta, carrot cake.\n\nThe outdoor seating was a disappointment for lunch and yes service little slow",
            "They sever a good variety of bread and other baking products but only selected items are good. The must try items are brownies, chocochip cookies, banana bread, sandwiches, pizza etc. They sever few items which don\u2019t really have any purpose but just to attract kids(eg: Nutella Brioche), these kind of items might dissatisfy people."

They have good mic system, please make sure its in working condition and there is AV operator in stand by through out the party\n- This place is strictly for a small group. Statis crowd should not exceed 60 - 65 pax. You can enjoy the place to fullest with 50-60 pax.\n- Since it is roof top, summers can be pain ful even with coolers. There is always this tension of rain ;P\n\nWith the above exceptions, i loved the place. Their suite rooms are one of the best in the area at a reasonable price. Their ala carte menu also serves the best veg food in this part of the city.",

We ordered the cake too from them as i wanted a normal cake.\nThe birthday party was a huge hit with guests raving about the food. The starters were yummiest amongst all. Baby corn chilli garlic is the best. Bajjis were very hot and good. The highlight of the day was SIGNATURE drink from the lime. It was lemonade kind. Guests were\nenjoying it alot.\nWe wanted no onion no garlic items in t\nthe menu. Dal was very tasty without onions and garlic. Elders were surprised to see that in a restaurant they could get it.\nOne of my relatives commented that he ate such great spread after 10 years in a restaurant.\nWhat else does a host need?\nI strongly recommend lime for those who want great vegetarian food at best price.

It had some loose pieces of fat or skin (which I'm not fond of) and that kinda put me off. A pounded chicken breast without all those \"things\" in between holding the flesh, would have been better.

I've had cheaper and better momos from roadside vendors.They also made my stomach upset which is a sure sign of them serving old and unhygienic food since even the roadside momos have never done this to me.\n\nI would definitely steer clear of this place, especially if you have ever had even half decent momos from anywhere else.  Also this is the first time someone has given mayo with momos and I can confirm that the combination is as disgusting as it sounds.If you have poor taste in food or have a stomach made of iron, then sure, go ahead and order from this farce of a momo joint. Otherwise learn from my mistake and let it be the only one to have occurred.",
            "All the Hyderabadis out here, anybody who here who loves street food, obviously, DLF is out there for you ! But don't forget to look out for this shop. You would find steamed and fried momos, but it's very rare to find kurkure momos. Have you even heard about those? Wanna grap a taste ? Go to DLF right away ! :)\nIt's mouth smacking.",
            "One of the best places to have momos in and around gachibowli. Located right opposite to DLF this place is over till late night. My favourite is the kurkure momo here. Tastes very different from all the other momos. Must try.",
            "Paneer fried momo was yummy. Thank you, the Mayo and sauce was good. Momos could be more softer, fried was too crispy. Taste could also improve much more.",
            "Watching ipl and ordred norfest, thought of adding some appetizer to my meal...ordered kurkure momos vegetarian.\n\nArrived nice and hot and on time\n\nProblem- the fried kurkure felt fried on stale oil, the coating was really thick tasted more of the oil coating than anything inside.\n\nSauce was mayo and red sauce. I am not sure how ppl eat mayo with momos? Antways i tried the red sauce , thinking that sauce may help with thick coating and oil, sauce was realy confusing zero taste just sodium thats it!\n\nLessons- never order fried momos again EVER! May try the steamed based on rating.",
            "I am addicted to their chicken Kurkure momos.\n\nIt's so yummy. Thanks for bringing momos culture to Hyderabad. Hoping to see this culture springs a lot in future.",
            "I never had a good momos until before I ordered from here. Always thght momos were over-rated. But Momos Delight proved me wrong. I ordered veg- kurkure momos through Zomato and they were lip-smacking good. The red-chilli chutney and mayonnaise were good combination with the momos. Also, they were delivered to me when they are still hot. Zomato\u2019s service has never been disappointing.",
            "It may appear slightly expensive for momos. But they truly taste as amazing if not better than the best momos you had in a north eastern Indian city. Especially the steamed chicken momos with the masala spread and the super spicy chutney perfectly compliments it",
            "Want to enjoy best steamed momos, this is a must visit place. Chicken or veg they got tasty momos here.\nThey provide momos with mayo and red sauce.",
            "Ordered momos from here many times.This place is good for momo lovers like me.I have tried their kukure chicken momo and steamed chicken momo and both are nice.The price of kukure momo is a bit high but it's crispy and tasty so worth a try.",
            "We have been a regular customer of momos delight. We usually order kurkure momos its super tasty can give 5 stars for tht. Couldnt click a pic of tht we finished it fast. And the next one is fried chicken momos thts also a must try.",
            "I would not recommend this place. I tried their steamed momos and kurkure ones too which were not upto the mark. They dont serve that spicy red chutney that was a bigger shock for me.",
            "The Best in n around gachibowli. The best among all. No doubt the shop is small, btw quality is good and worth the money u pay. Try it without hessitating.\nGood good good \u2764 \ud83d\udc95",
            "I have been here and had it's momos. It was not that great! So i had ordered chicken steamed momos on zomato and was disheartened to find that the momos have degraded further in it's taste. The outer covering was dry and not well cooked. It tasted like it was not freshly made. The filling was not satisfying at all. Moreover the salt was a bit over the top. The sauce served was excessively salty and tasted like tomato sauce mixed with chilli paste. Not good at all. I had been in their shop quite e few times but this time it was really disappointing.",
            "I've ordered several times from this place and their Kurkure Momos are simply awesome. They taste just how you get them in Delhi. Even the fried and steamed momos are good but can't beat Kurkure Momos!",
            "One of the best places to have momos. Had ordered quite a few times from this place through swiggy and zomato. Delivery was on time and packaging was good.\nChicken momos were simply awesome, liked it. Chicken Fried Momos were also good .\nMayonnaise was nice, momo sauce could be better though.",
            "So on one of the weeknite i craved for momos.Most of the delivery points were closed except this.So thot to give it a try.Delivery was delayed and that made me lil upset.I ordered two things: Veg steamed momos and chicken steamed momos.\n\nVeg steamed momos:The packaging was real bad and u cud see momos out of the silver foil box.The filling of the momo wasnt really pleasing and was not tasty enuf to swat my mood.The veggies seemed to be over burnt and they didnt smell good either.The schezwan chutney that they usually setve with momos was more lookinglike tomato ketchup and the quantity was so lil that it cud just suffice 1 momo.\nChichen steamed momo:All of the above applies though the chicken smelled as if it was day old.\n\nHighly disappointing! 2stars just for the zomato valet!",
            "Known for its momos.\nBeen to this place couple of times.\nHad fried momos in veg and paneer.\nMomos, served with mayonnaise and spicy sauce.\nTastes good.\n\nOverall ok."

While the Dark was awesome, the other two items disappointed me. The Salad had very raw cucumber and it gave me a bad stomach pain from which I'm still suffering. They also gave a plastic fork to eat a salad which has chicken, cucumber, lettuce, capsicum and tomato. Giving plastic fork to substitute real cutlery is way more disappointing than anything in a place as reputed as TCR. The mint Mojito was a tad bit less disappointing. The syrups flavor dominated all the way till half the glass!"

            "found them on Zomato website, a very interesting to say that this restaurant carved a niche in serving juicy  chicken wings with wide spread of 10 to 12 sauces especially Texas BBQ, Spicy garlic too yummy and spicy like Original hot and Amazon wild comes in to top of mind. Did ordered their bulk wings of 20 pieces and chicken drum sticks tossed with theses sauces were amazing. Dyna pasta served here  with white sauce is a perfect balance with a little spicy. Over all they have apt combination of mojitos like lemonade and strawberry one can have a very good combo. Biryanis served here us very special like Wings Biryani and drum sticks have a large quantity matched quality as well. over all its a best and only to discover a new taste of their popular chicken wings at a very reasonable place.",
            "Out of hunger and trust on the restaurant I ordered a chicken burger from American wild wings, Gachibowli hoping it would be tasty and healthy but the kind of service i recieved was really pathetic. At first the restaurant took almost 40 mins to prepare just a small chicken burger, i tried calling restaurant about the update and they weren't even responsive, didn't answer any of my call. I kept my patience and waited for the order to arrive. aftr receiving the order what i saw was really a bad experience. The french fries that I used to get always were replaced by some oily, smelly, rotten potato pakodis. Not just that I hoped my burger to be nice but it was again a big disappointment. The very first bite of it tasted really bad. Chicken seemed fried to be in very bad oil and smelled filthy. I had to throw it after my first three bites. And then after sometime i even started Having pain in my stomach . This particular experience of mine was very disappointing with american wild wings. I didn't think of myself to waste money, wait for an hour and still get suffer after Eating that food",

            "So on my latest visit to this amazing American themed place, i had an amazing experience. We kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant. There were desi and videshi khaana both.\nWe started off with the forte of this place ,WINGS. We had texas bbq chicken wings, amazon wild chicken wings, and pattaya thai chicken wings. I personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings. Chicken was rightly done in every single dish. Preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there. The only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified.\nThere were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d\n.\nComing to the salad , i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks \u2764\ufe0f\n.\nThe fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy. It was an instant favorite.\n.\nKuch desi khaana we had in there were Gongura chicken and dum biryani combo. Shocked? Well hum bhi hue the. But lemme tell you it was a delightful combo , gongura chicken being the best \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f A must try.\n.\n.\nSome snacks we had in there were Chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too. The nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top. \ud83d\ude0d The popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side. Otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted .\n\nTaste wise : 4.5/5\nPrice: 5/5\nAmbience: 4/5\nAllover: 4.8/5 (a sure visit)",
            "*Visit By Invite*\n\nLocated in a buzy spot, this joint has definitely some good food to offer.\n\nWe tried a host of items from the menu. Starting off with Chicken Nuggets which were the show stopper. Next up we had Chicken wings, which to be honest didn't excite us too much apart from the barbeque chicken wings.\n\nFried Chicken burger had a tender and juicy patty served along some good french fries. Chicken popcorn were a major disappointment and the raw material used didn't look fresh. Chicken drumsticks gave nice visual as well as taste appeal. To keep the show running, we had caesar salad on the side which definetly requires a revamp and the joint can play with salad dressings, spices rather than having it served just with mayo.\n\nIn the end, we had Biryani which gets served under the brand of Fireblast Biryani. This biryani has still a long way to go and in order to beat the best of Biryani's in town need some more experiments with flavors.\n\nWhile food here is decent, the ambiance requires immideat attention. The entrace was cluttered and the back of counter was clogged with unwanted items. A bit of touch up in both food and ambiance can turn this into a 5 star rating experience. #TheWandererFoodies\n\nthewandererfoodies.wordpress.com",
            "Heard through word of mouth that this is best place in gachibowli to taste quality chicken wings , special wings and drum stick biriyani at an economy price.

            "Hello Hyderabad..!!!!!My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the  awesome food court around Hitech City and Gachibowli. it is  located near the DLF signals and beside Creamstone Gachibowli above Thick Shakes. \nThe ambiance is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.\n\nThe menu design with array spans of Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits\n\nRed hot roasted Chicken Wings  \u2764\ufe0f - Juicy chicken wings are coated and fried along with Mexican                                                                   Jerk Suces Yummy unforgettable. \n\nCrispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.\n\nDrum Stick Dum Biryani-\nOMG very different as i never experienced trust me  you guys will fall in love with it. \nDrum Sticks \u2764\ufe0f - Nachos topped with red sauce and I JUST  loved it.  \nCombos \u2764\ufe0f - The true fact i have ever seen even in KFC, Mc-Donald's such awesome combi within a convincing budget. loved it. \n\nI cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out all kinds biryanis so far The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mock-tails. Sluches chocolate flav is an absolute delight! Also a fan of coke float.\n\nThe staff is ever so courteous. Awesome place to hangout with friends it really fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!!!!!",
            "It's hard to find places which give delivery upto morning 4am. American Wild wings is one of them. It's just beside Creamstone, Gachibowli. They deliver chicken wings,salad,popcorn,fries,biriyani and Andhra style chicken from evening till morning . They have a decent seating arrangement too. For chicken wings, you got almost 10/12 sauces to choose upon. Among them my favorite are Texas BBQ and Mexican jerk. Also tried their strawberry mocktail which was refreshing. Their biriyani comes with drumsticks / wings. Tried the drumstick biriyani. Chicken were well spicy and well with Curry leaves ( Andhra style). Service,ambience and prices all were decent. Nothing fancy to be expected.\nSo if you are planning to have something beforig indulging urself in Creamstone visit here.\n\natoneplaceonline.com",
            "American Wild Wings is an affordable version of B-dubs. Mainly focused on Wings, Fries and Burgers with a touch of Desi dishes as well.\n\nI was there with my wife for dinner and we had a delightful time as we both love Chicken Wings. The various Sauces on offer is amazing. We tried Pattaya Thai, Texas BBQ, Mexican Jerk, Original Hot and Amazon Wild. I liked BBQ and Original Hot, both were exceptional. We then moved on to Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Fried Burger and Grilled Chicken Salad. Nuggets were amazing, crispy and soft while Burger and Salad were delicious as well.\n\nWe had this with a few soft drinks and mocktails, namely Lemonade and Mango. Both were pretty good but can be improved.\n\nService was great. We were very well taken care by Mr Srinivas, the branch manager. Ambience is okay and needs to be worked upon a bit being an upcoming fast-food joint.\n\nOverall, an excellent place for Chicken Wing lovers and that too at a moderate price range.",

I love wings so wanted to check out this place.\nIt's a small cozy place, giving cafe feels. Interiors are decent and so is the seating. There aren't any sections as the place is streched longitudinaly. They have self service system.\nComing to food and menu,\nThe menu looks quite economical with respect to the portion size of the food and taste. So it is value for money. The only thing which needs improvement is the presentation of the dishes.\nTaste, quantity and price are all up to the mark.\nI tried their signature sauces for the mains, texas bbq, Pattaya thai, spicy garlic, original hot, Mexican jerk and Amazon wild. To my surprise all the wings were delicious specially the bbq and original hot, loved them.\nTried out the chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken... Among which nuggets were really good but chicken popcorn needs some improvement.\nThe menu seems interesting as they also serve biryani, not the authentic one but related to their respective genre, like wings dum biryani and drumsticks dum biryani. The quantity of chicken in the biryani was heavy and it tasted good too. Also had the chef special gongura chicken which was not on the menu. It was the star of the evening though, tatse, texture everything was perfect.\nAlso had a ceaser salad which required more dressing and flavour. Had fried chicken burger too, which was tasty and ya tastier than the KFC burger.\nOverall the place is affordable and nice. The hospitality was very nice. Thanks Mr. Srinivas, you were always up your feet and served us well. The staff is humble and friendly.\nRecommended!!",
            "A great hangout place for the IT employees and with with really reasonable prices.\n\nPeaceful ambience with no much of chaos in the place.\n\nOrder was taken as per our wishlist and made the items accordingly with the required spicyness and etc.\n\nWe had chicken fry , chicken nuggets and chicken popcorn and then boneless chicken biryani which were served really very hot and tasty.\n\nOverall a very comfortable place with affordable prices and quality food.\n\nWould surely drop by sometime whenever possible :)",
            "American Wild Wings is a very affordable place which serves quality wings. Located in Gachibowli main road, just beside creamstone, it is a place to relish Chicken Wings.\n\nI tried out their Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Salad, Chicken Fried Burger and Various Chicken Wings. The sauce I loved the most was BBQ Chicken Wings. Chicken Nuggets were amazing as well.\n\nWe tried their Lemonade and Mango Mojito, they were okay but can be improved. The service by Mr Srinivas is quick and he is very understanding. Ambience needs a bit of touch up here and there especially at the entrance.\n\nThis place is a must try for their Wings and Nuggets.",
            "Rating - 3.5\n\nVisited this place on a Friday evening. The interiors are okayish, they need to work alot upon that.\n\nNow coming to food:\n\nWe tried their wings in 8-9 different sauces. Most of them were really good and the chicken was fresh and meat fell off the bone.\n\nMy personal favorite was Mexican jerk, Barbeque and Konaseema. Though the sauces can be reduced a little.\n\nAlso the lemon garlic and original hot need to be improved. The lemon garlic had so much oil in it and the original hot tasted nothing but red chilli powder.\n\nWe also ordered Virgin Mojito which was very very sweet for our palate.\n\nThe Chicken Caesar salad was a big disappointment as it was full of lettuce and sauces. The chicken was very chewy.\n\nWe also ordered Chicken Biryani and Patiala Chicken.\n\nThe biryani was good but had a lot of oil in it. Meat was fresh and tender.\n\nPatiala Chicken had good flavors but alot of masala in it.\n\nAlso the Chicken Popcorn can be completely avoided as the chicken is very rubbery and needs alot of improvement.\n\nThe white sauce pasta again was very sweet for our liking.\n\nOverall this place needs alot of improvement but you can definitely try out their wings as they are good and economically priced.",
            "American Wild Wings is another fast food joint located amidst the Cream Stone outlet of Gachibowli. The place is open and has an ideal sitting space for 20-30 people. Went there with my friends to try out their food. I found their Ambiance quite ordinary and I felt it can get some makeover.\n\nStarting with their appetizers, We first tried out their in house Chicken wings. So, the chicken wings served over here are classified into various types. They offer a wide range of sauces for their wings ranging from classic Texas BBQ, Pattaya Thai, Spicy Garlic, Amazon wild etc.\n\nMy personal favorite of the lot had to be Original hot Chicken wings and Mexican wild Chicken wings. The wings were super juicy and delicious. However, I also feel that the sauce content was too much for the wings which can be slightly reduced in order to make it taste perfect.\n\nNext up, we had their Classic Chicken Nuggets and Popcorn Chicken. The nuggets were super tasty and very much similar to what we usually get to eat at all fast food outlets. The Popcorn chicken was chewy. It requires serious attention and changes.\n\nFor mains, the place has also introduced authentic Indian dishes such as Chicken Biryani with Salan, Raita and Gongura Chicken. The Gongura Chicken was an absolute relish. To my surprise, the meat fell of the bone quite nicely and it worked really nicely with the clean flavors of the Biryani.\n\nThanks for a wonderful time Mr. Srinivas. Moreover, this place is comparatively quite pocket friendly and can be given a shot for their Chicken Wings anyday. Happy eating, :)",
            "They say \"count your chicken before they hatch\" and this weekend I did almost that. Hehehe, well, we were counting them before having it \ud83d\ude06\ud83c\udf57\ud83d\ude09.\n\nOur visit was an invite for a complimentary lunch by Mr. Srinivas Lanka incharge of the restaurant operations, management and marketing. This place on a main location of Gachibowli, Hyderabad with a dine-in. They offer American Cuisine for \ud83d\udc14\ud83d\udc13\ud83c\udf57 chicken lovers and as the name suggests they specialise in Chicken Wings.\n\nWe got some thirst-quenching mojito mocktails- lemonade, orange and strawberry. They also offer slushies but was not available at that time. Moving on as suggested we ordered the wings with 4 kinds of sauces- Pattaya Thai, Spicy Garlic, Texas BBQ and Mexican Jerk (\ud83d\udc48 this one was my favourite). They were slightly crispy on outside and juicy on the inside.\n\nPattaya Thai- spicy sauce with coarse texture\nSpicy Garlic- Finely chopped garlic and chilli flakes sauce\nTexas BBQ- the same old barbecue sauce with sweet and savoury taste and a hit of chilli. \nMexican Jerk- a sweet and spicy smooth textured sauce that won my \ud83d\udc93.  \n\nWe also ordered for Popcorn Chicken which was crispy fried but not very impressive, Original Patty burger which was quite simple (no veggies in it, not even the basic ones like- tomato, onion rings or lettuce) and was served pretty hot with French fries so be careful when you take a bite. We also ordered for Asian (fried) Chicken Salad but was served with Caesar Chicken salad \ud83e\udd57, which was little disappointing to taste as well.\n\nYou can definitely visit this place on Fridays and Saturdays for drinks (liquor) as well. So here is my rating on this-  \n\nFood- 4/5 (this is just for the chicken wings alone)\nService- 3.5/5 (little slow but courteous staff)\nAmbience- 3/5 (nice and decent)\n\nOverall I would like to rate it 3.8/5 as there is lot of scope for improvement in future.\n\nFor a detailed review please visit- curiousfoodieswanderlust.home.blog \nFollow me on- Instagram and Facebook- @curiousfoodieswanderlust, Curious Foodies Wanderlust",

I asked him to do it at the moment and he said, his manager is busy so it cant be done right now but he assured me that it will be done. \n\nI talked to his manager on the phone, and he completely denied my refund. \nHe didn't care about customer service, he talked very rudely, and he said he's not going to follow the policy. He also said I don't care if you accept the order or return it.\n(If this was the case, why did the delivery boy ensure my refund and tried to run off?)\n\nPeople like this don't deserve to be a part of DOMINOS.\nThey're completely ruining the franchise image.",

The branch number on Zomato was incorrect. Called up Dominos hotline and they said they'll reach out to the branch and they'll call back. Waited for 15 min. No call back. Called the hotline again and the guy puts me on hold while he reaches out to the branch. 5 min later i am disconnected. Called up again and the same message that they will reach out to the branch is thrown on my face. Finally had it enough and asked them to cancel my order and refund the money.\n\nI anyway don't eat Dominos pizza given some pretty bad prior experience. But ordered on my wife's insistence. Congratulations. Now even my wife doesn't want to order Dominos ever again. :)\n\n1. Zomato doesn't have any view on what the restaurant is doing with the order. The system automatically said food is being prepared when clearly the restaurant has no clue on the order.\n\n2. Dominos hotline is worthless.

The service was poor and slow. I am not sure whether that is for quantity of staff or the quality of staff.\nNone of the staff was nice or responsive in a way that makes you feel good.\n3.

The breakfast option with the stay is a must pick and do try as much as possible from the spread.\nA few other things which I liked were the baked potatoes. Just loved them.\nAnother good thing about them was that they did not cut the fruits beforehand. You had to select your choice and they were cut right in front of you. In the juices section, I could remember a carrot \ud83e\udd55 ginger, tulsi, aloevera and many such. Detox water was another addition.

I went for the tenderloin burger cooked medium. This patty has some herbs mixed in it, so if you like some rosemary and thyme in your patty, try it out.\nFor 850 rupees including taxes, I can say it\u2019s on par with other offerings in the city with a different twist to their burger. 3.5 stars for their burger.",

They replied with bullshit answers..!\n\nOnly thing we liked is the place and ambience..!!\n\nI recommend not to prefer this place with family..!!\n\nThis management has shown us how a famous brand like Hyatt can also be the worst experience..!!!",
            "Prices are 5 star hotel\u2019s but food and hospitality is just as normal restaurant\nAmbience is good\nI suggest them to increase the hospitality",
            "Food and Managment sucks and this place . There is no kids activity as said .The manager is behaving like a regular tiffin center person .Wrong dish names are placed on many items . I don't suggest at all . They charged 2199 plus taxes but on zomato it shows less and different. When we asked abt it they gave all bullshit answers .",
            "Very very disappointed. Had been there for a Sunday brunch and experienced a worst and slow service. The food is below average. Nothing organised and well maintained. The managers are the worst in Collage restaurant, very unmannered and impolite. Many of the dishes nameplates are mismatched. The brunch prices don\u2019t match the Zomato prices.",
            "I visited Collage with friends and was impressed by the ambiance and the service. My server Tushar was very patient and attentive. Tried his suggestion of pasta and it turned out delicious. I would definitely recommend this place again.",
            "Visited this restaurant thinking to have good food, but the efforts were wasted. We went on a Friday and we started eating the starters. After starters when we asked for main course, the staff told that on Friday they have only street food and no main course is available. Felt like we wasted our money.\n\nThough the starters were good, but main course should also be there. Street food should be the add on and not the only food.\n\nTwo stars only for the ambience.\n\nshubhamtraveltales.wordpress.com",
            "I've had the breakfast buffet here quite a number of times and it is really a very good spread they have here.\nThey have 3 main live counters - one which makes fresh Dosas and Parathas, second makes the waffles and pancakes and the third makes all the egg varieties.\nThey also have a huge counter for fruits, juices and herbal shots.\nThen there is the Indian food counter which has multiple varieties like - chicken curry or Keema curry with Pav, Idli and Wada with Sambhar and 3 types of chutney, Poha or something similar, and few more items.\nThere is also a counter which serves noodles, sauteed veggies, steamed fish or chicken and Chicken sausages, congee and Miso soup.\nThen there is counter with cheeses, cold cuts, pre-made salad, some sweet jars, etc.\nThen there's obviously the cereal counter and the breads counter which has amazing Danish bakery items, bread pudding and other baked breads.\nThat's a huge list!\nTo top it all, the staff is really courteous and polite and the outside seating is simply serene.",
            "Honestly I would not recommend this place to any of my friends or colleagues. I had dropped by with my colleagues for lunch (buffet) and we really had high expectations and were hoping for good food. Unfortunately all the starters were cold and were not even edible :(!! The biryani\nThe taste was not even close to the expectations. A big NO NO to food lovers.\nThe only good thing here was the jazzy decor and desserts. It was a very poor experience overall.",
            "I went to Hyatt on Valentine's eve around 12am. This place is quiet and comfy but infested with mosquitoes (last thing that u will expect from Hyatt). We ordered North Indian food which was quite yummy but the service was painfully slow. When u enter Hyatt, u don't expect this kind of treatment. Unfortunately, my date was ruined.\nWill recommend others not to visit this place just because of Hyatt tag",
            "Visited the place at Midnight\nThe best thing is it has constant menu for all 24hours unlike most of the late night restaurants\nThe place looks really great at night\nOrdered Pastas which were awesome although we got it 40min after ordering which needs to be taken care of\nWill visit again"

            "The best place in Hyderabad to have Pork and beef together. Amazing taste & quality of meat, a paradise for north eastern cuisine lovers, Zing's serves large varieties of non-veg dishes in a pocket-friendly budget. Just a reminder, this is not a place to have vegeterian foods. I have read many reviews explaining how the vegetarian people were apalled by the smell of raw/ cooked meat while visiting this restaurant. They are very misleading and misinformative. First of all, you shouldn't be here if you are looking for veg momo or veg fried rice. Period.\nI tried almost every pork starters and every mocktails available in their menu. Not once I have been disappointed. Every food items is tasty enough to deserve 5 rating.\nThe one little place for improvement could be to increase the number of staffs. Due to excessive demand, they find it difficult to cater to everyone at the same pace, hence you'd find many reviews telling how their service is slow, how people waited for 1 hour after ordering for food to show up. Personally, i've never experienced such delay.\n\nP.S. They cook amazing Ramyun Noodles.",
            "Very authentic food, different from what you get elsewhere in Hyderabad. Their dumplings, pork ribs, beef fry, everything was awesome. Great job !",
            "This place has been a bookmark for me since very long as there are only few places which can serve pork. After seeing all those positive reviews in Zomato, I decided to give it a try.\nI along with 3 of my friends went on a Friday Eve to this place.\n\nAppetizers :\n\n1. Deojikalbi : This is a pork appetizer, we loved it very much and repeated the order. For the second time, we asked the restaurant staff to increase spice levels in the dish which turned out to be really delicious.\n\n2. Pork ribs : I did not enjoy this dish really much. Meat was tender but the sauces they used did not satisfy my taste buds. I dunno if north-east people love this type of food but it's ok, it was my first time.\n\n3. Pepper chicken : Due to unavailability of lemon grass chicken, we had to order this appetizer. Taste was good , nothing fancy.\n\nMain Course :\n\n1. Ramyun with Pork : we ordered 2 rumyun with pork, taste was good but we liked the other dish which we ordered.\n\n2. Soba noodles with pork and veggies : This dish tops the list. Luckily, I am the one who ordered this dish and my friends were having ramyun.\nSoba noodles have a dark sauce and intense taste compared to ramyun. If tasted really delicious. I cannot say how perfect this dish is.\n\n3. Naga-chicken rice : When restaurant staff placed this dish on our table, I saw chicken was undercooked. I asked the same to them, they said this is how north-east people like to eat, a bit chewy. I thought chalo let's try it, but chicken was so chewy that it's taking 5 minutes for me to complete a small piece of it.\nI was disappointed with this dish.\n\nOverall experience :\n\nFood : 3.5 / 5\nService : 3/5 ( it was too slow)\nAmbience : 3.5 / 5 (cute lil place but gets crowded on weekends)\n\nI will definitely recommend this place to everyone. Sometimes we need to surprise our taste buds with some new cuisine \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude0b and this place has got delicious food too.",
            "The authentic taste of North East Indian delicacies, one will find here with mouthwatering dishes. Good place good location. But the quantity of food per dish served is little smaller.",
            "Couldn't resist posting this review. Has been visiting this place since the time it opened - has been there multiple times. Never before felt this urge of posting a review since the food always stood out and dominated the service.\n\nBut nothing changed over the time in terms of service, rather it's turned worse over time. There can't be an excuse of quality of food in exchange of service. If food is the only yardstick, they fail to beat that as well. Dishes are pretty authentic but equally monotonous in taste.\n\nAs a customer, I would rather not visit to wait for two ordered dishes for an hour. Worse food that can be had sooner is always better than slightly better food with infinitely worse service.",
            "Food is not bad but not like northeast. Service are very slow n staff will not response properly. I didn't understand its northeast food or korean food. I ask for northeast food n disappointed.",
            "Have been to this place so many times that I\u2019ve lost count. Great food, (especially the beef and pork dishes, although at times some of them seem similar)\nGood value for money... be patient for the service. Worth visiting at least once, then give it a chance to win you over",
            "A fine and cute place like that of a cottage to have variety dishes!\n\nDrinks:\n\n1. Berry blast: Loved it, i would say it is my version of a drink. The right maroon version of the combination of the flavor of sweetness more than sour.\n\n2. Green ice mountain mojito: You can find green apples in this drink. A little sour, although i liked it.\n\nI would like to suggest to bring the drinks along with the main course rather than us having to wait and ask for it after the main course.\n\nTeriyaki chicken: served with flavored rice. Nothing special about its taste. This is a thumbs down comparing to the other dishes i had.\n\nBeef & Pork kimchi bokkum bap: I just liked the flavor of the rice. Both of it had a unique taste although both appeared the same. They were mixed with the right quantity of pork/beef. The piece were eatable, and not much chewy.\n\nPork & Beef Naga chilly curry: The flavor of these were almost the same although beef and pork has its own taste. The taste was fine with the right amount of chilly spiciness. The gravy is ravishing as well.\n\nService: Just fine. The waiter didn't have a pleasant look on taking our order/serving us.\n\nOverall fine dining experience:\n\nAmbiance - 4.5/5\n\nFood (worth the money) - 4/5\n\nService: 3.5/5",
            "A little understaffed when I visited on a Friday evening, and while the food lived up to its usual great standards, I was kind of bummed out that all of their salads and their spinach and mushroom dumplings were unavailable. I have not been able to order a salad in the 4 or 5 times I have been here. Kudos to the team for their effort, nonetheless. I know it was a busy night for a small 2 person service team.",
            "Went there after hearing a lot of buzz about this being a go to North Eastern place, but such a bummer!\nAmbience : 1star: the place doesn't not have exhaust or ventilation and has only 2 ACs which seemed to not work. it's connected to the kitchen so was smelling of the meat. No music. We were asked to occupy a table which had used plates still kept.\nService: 1 star. The staff didn't seem very welcoming and had be prompted twice or thrice before they attended to us.\nNot to mention it took them 30 minutes just to get the mocktails(we already read about their slow service so was expecting it)\nNon veg food: momos were very average like that of zomos may be.\nVeg: the ramyum noodles were literally veg Maggi! Very misleading name and price.\nVeg kimchi rice was stale and smelling of old rice.",
            "This place should realise that a dine-in restaurant has to provide some basic service and just having decent food is only the starting. The place offers good for nothing snobbish service by staff that cannot communicate and who don't give a damn about you. You can die asking for something and you won't get it. They don't even bother to keep cutlery at the table, not even tissue papers. The AC does not work and on a summer afternoon the place is like an oven.\n\nComing to food. If you manage to get what you like on the menu, it is a miracle. They open at 11.30. We asked for their weekend only dishes on a weekend at 1.30 and were told very unapologetic, rather rudely that they don't have it. Finally after we managed to find something that we liked and they had, we were told it would take 35 mins because a party of six had placed a big order. Now the taste. The ingredients are very good and fresh. The quality of pork is great. The taste doesn't have much variation. Everything is super spicy with just the proportion of sauces being different. After a while the taste buds just go numb with the spice. If this is how the food of North eastern India is, well, I'll avoid that geography. And I'll surely avoid this eatery. There is no excuse for bad and rude service!",
            "This was on our list of places to eat in Hyderabad for a while, but what kept us not going is the popularity with Meat! I am a vegetarian and wondered what i will get, seeing bibimbap on the menu , i had to try it.\n\nWe ordered fried tofu appetiser and bibimbop and freshlime+square.\n\nDrinks were as displayed, tofu was bit disappointing..it was literally fried tofu with sauce on it and sesame seeds..can miss this if you plan to go.\n\nDo definitely try the bap! Tasty and filling, great portions of the veggies, rice, sauce...although rice wasnt sticky and i thought dolsot bap always came with hot claypot..nevertheless tasty!\n\nIn the middle of the meal we asked for hot sauce and there came the sauce very tiny quantity, we were like WTF..the sauce was HOT made from naga chillies yet sooo good..burned my tongue but loved every bit of it..so if you have rice remaining give this a try as well.\n\nStaff were courteous as well.\n\nOne star less just for the tofu. Rest was perfect\n\nWill definitely visit again",
            "It's amazing for the people who eat Beef & Pork. The Lemon Grass Chicken was good too.\n\nI only eat chicken but I have seen that all the dishes were very well cooked and the texture was nice. My friends loved them.\n\nMust visit for the people who like Beef or Pork or North East Food.",
            "The food was delicious but the service was hilarious I'm giving 3 star only bcz of the food we have to cll again and again more then 5 times after than finally. They come",
            "Amazing amazing amazing\nThe best place to have all kind of pork dishes. they are just cooked to perfection, honestly better than the 5 star restaurants in town.\nAmazing food for amazing prices.\nSuper budget friendly\n\nSo happie to have found this place for my pork fix.\nAdded to weekly outing to my schedule."

I particularly love the Naughty Lucy burger, which is an all time favourite.\nThis time I decided to try their new Grilled Chicken Monster Burger and I was a little disappointed. As a whole, the burger tasted fine but, why on earth did the chicken burger have a layer of hash browns?

            "Located in SLN Terminus on the ground floor, this joint has a good seating and decent ambience.\n\nThe place is a bad maintained one in terms of staff and food. A donut shop must have sugar glazed donuts at all times, but initially they refused to serve one.\n\nFinally the donut I had was the Caramel Vanilla, the donut was first served cold despite telling them to heat it. The donut anyways turned out to be a good one, perfectly sweet and hot. The caramel however was not upto the mark.\n\nFor the drink I had Vanilla Macchiato, the drink was way different from illustration. It lacked the caramel sauce on top and almost had no taste of vanilla, we also ordered for classic macchiato which tasted the same. So there was no vanilla in my coffee.\n\nI would suggest skip this place and head somewhere else for the sweet cravings post dinner.",

Alongwith the popular chocolate ones do try the caramel, strawberry and colour pop ones too. Also do try Hot Chocolate Orange and Hot Chocolate HazelNut, definitely a must try place for me.",

            "The donuts were fresh and tasty. However these donuts were little small in size compared to donuts served in other outlets. The ambience was good but needs a little maintenance like the tables were not clean and there were flies around.\nOverall it was good.",
            "I just came out of this outlet. The food is as per DD standards but the venue lacked basic hygiene and maintenance.\n\nThe tables were not cleaned on time and hence it had flies hovering around it. The wipe used for cleaning the table too was so dirty that it left a stench behind after the table was cleanes.\n\nFor payment too when I decided to pay through the mobile wallet, instead of the standard QR code or getting a request for the OTP, I was asked to pay the same to the store managers number as their system wasn't working.",
            "Just 5 mins from my house and been there hardly a few times because I did not quite soulfully enjoyed their donuts. The 'ugh' quotient is missing in the do-ugh-nuts here which makes me do-not do the Dunkin Donuts.",
            "Bit Costly..but taste wise its good...almost the taste of usa...good variety of items to choose from. Good place to visit. Ambiance is good also",
            "Though the brand's famous for donuts, I'd have to start the review with their Burger. After having got bored with McD, KFC and other popular burger places, DD's burgers are just stunning. Also, their bun is slightly different, which tastes even better over others.  The chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in. Unfortunately, it is overpriced!\n\nComing to their staple food, they are great as well. They got tons of options, so not possible to review all of them here. But, I would highly suggest having their Death by Chocolate.\n\nAnd, their packaging is great. I loved the boxes they provided!"

Overall a healthy dish. I also tried mutter panner here. It tasted good.\nThe vibe here is happening with good music and they also have birthday celebration space.\nI would recommend this place.",

The littis were good enough however the chokha was bland..the only taste i was getting was of mustard. No freshmess of coriander, flavour of garlic, or onion taste. Both of the chutneys wrre tasting almost the same. The only dominating taste was of raw mustard which overpowered everything. The food lacked freshness.\nThey need to work on making fresh chokha with fresh flavours.",

They have great Afghani and arabian food....their a little pricy and the chinese food is too spicy.... If u haven't been here, give it a try but avoid the Chinese side of the menu(Unless you are a fan of SPICY food)",

            "This is a newly opened restaurant in Gachibowli. It is famous for it's Nizami style of cuisine. It is very spacious and has a cozy ambience with good music.\n\nDishes that we have tried:\n\n1. Chicken Hot & Sour Soup\n2. Chicken Manchow Soup\n3. Eight Treasure Soup\n4. Chicken Platter\n5. Daawat Khaas Sabz Kebab Platter\n6. Daawat Khaas Murgh Musallam\n7. Zafrani Roti\n8. Paneer Pasanda\n9. Kaddu Ki Kheer\n\nThe food served here is delicious and mouth-watering. The pictures of the famous dishes served here are displayed in the LCD Tv's. Just the pictures themselves will activate all your taste buds. If you are going with a group of 6-8 members, I suggest you order platters instead of individual starters.\n\nWe have ordered Chicken Platter and Daawat Khaas Sabz Kebab Platter. The chicken Platter comes with 4 variety of chicken starters with 6 pieces for the each variety. And Veg platter is served with Paneer Tikka Kebab, Tandoori Broccoli and starter of cauliflower. Both veg and Non-veg platters tasted great.\n\nIn the main course we have ordered the famous dish of this restaurant *Daawat Khaas Murgh Musallam* It comes with chicken marinated with ginger garlic paste and stuff with eggs and mutton keema. Leaving the Hyderabad biryani aside, this was the best main course item that I have tried in the recent times. It easily serves for 3-4 adults. And it is really a must try dish if you're visiting this restaurant. Apart from that we have ordered Paneer Pasanda with zafrani Roti. The Paneer Pasanda curry tasted little bit sweet and none of us have liked it.\n\nAnd coming to desserts we have ordered Kashmiri Rabdi and Kaddu ki Kheer. Both of them are really good.\n\nService:\n\nThe service here is really commendable. The staff is cordial and always available at your service. Within no time from ordering they serve the food hot at your plate.\n\nValue for money:\n\nI can't comment on the vegetarian food but for the non vegetarians this restaurant is a treat and the prices are worthy enough. We can try a variety of dishes which we haven't even encountered in the menu of regular Hyderabad restaurants. So mark it and visit this place for your next dining. Have good food and great experience :)",
            "I have ordered paneer pasanda yesterday night and received totally burnt paneer and uncooked gravy with a ton of turmeric..which was smelling disgusting..I couldn't even took a bite.worst food I have every received.",
            "As the name suggests, this place serves the authentic hyderabadi cuisine. This is a new place in town. The place is very spacious with proper seating arrangement and can be visited by friends and family. The staff was very courteous and friendly.\n\nWe first started off with Yakhni shorba which is a mutton soup. Then we tried few starters Daawat khaas-Murg sholay kebab, Phuket fish, Wok tossed chicken, Sikanderi raan and Daawat khaas- Chelo kebab.\nThen we tried main course Nalli gosht and Murgh lababdar with bread, Murg musallam and Hyderabadi mutton biryani.\nThen the mocktails Virgin mojito, Mojito fantasy(strawberry), coolers(coconut, cucumber, lime, mint), Mango mule, Blue hawaii, Soda fountain.\nWe ended our day with the desserts Shahi tukda and phirni."

            "My husband and I, visited Zega for their dimsum festival and we were not disappointed.\nThe service started with a delicious bowl of thukpa, which had a perfect blend of spice. Followed by an array of dimsums, each being delicious and warm. The chicken Gyoza was absolutely mind blowing. I could eat a zillion of those!\nThe dimsums (which we were full after) were followed by the main course which included fried rice/soft noodle with chicken and fish(we did not try the vegetarian dishes)\nThe cherry on the cake was the dessert! Toffee banana with ice Cream. Ugh! Delicious!!\nOur bill was ~ 1700/- for 2\nWorth every penny.\n\nAmbience-5/5\nTaste-5/5\nValue for money-5/5(surprisingly)\nService-4.5/5\n\nWill I visit again? Yes, maybe for a different food festival this time!",
            "Delicious,mouthwatering dishes and a must try dim sum lunch which is pocket friendly. The view,service and the food are 10 on 10. Kudos!!! to the team",

            "Zega is a beautiful Pan Asian restaurant located amidst the lavish property of Sheraton Hyderabad. The restaurant has got a great ambiance to it and serves some of the authentic Pan Asian dishes that one could ask for.\n\nI went there for their ongoing Dimsum food festival with my pals and had a great time overall. The Dimsum food festival had a variety of Thukpa options ranging from Chicken, Mutton, Pork and the veg version alongside some beautifully crafted dimsums inspired from China. Next up, there was an option for various wok tossed gravies and some delicious desserts.\n\nThe first thing to try out was their Chicken Thukpa. It was simply delicious. The broth was super special and it had a balanced proportion of sweet, spice and tang into it which was amazing. The amount of veggies and noodles were also quite balanced and overall, it was an absolute winner. This was something I personally recommend all of you to try.\n\nNext up, we were offered some of their Dimsums. The showstopper of the day were Pan fried Chicken Gyoza, Pok choi roasted garlic and Napa Cabbage Crystals, Prawn crystal wraps and Vegetable beijing dumpling. The Prawn crystal wraps had a tad sweet soy used as a sauce which could have had a slight more kick to it otherwise all these are a must try.\n\nFor mains, we ordered for Wok tossed Chicken in Dry chilli cashews, Crispy fish in chilli plum sauce along side Vegetable fried rice and Vegetable wok tossed soft noodles. The Chicken in dry chilli cashwes was the clear winner of the lot and was simply wonderful. It was a tad saltier in the first serving but we got it amended thanks to the chef. Overall, the main course was good and had clean, authentic flavors.\n\nWith out tummies full and our satisfaction levels reached, we decided to go ahead with their Toffee banana with palm sugar ice cream. This was magical. I have been a lover of Toffee banana but this fusion right here was mind blowing. The creaminess of the palm sugar ice cream went on fantastically with the crispy banana toffee and was a big boost for our palate.\n\nAll in all, it is a place to sit back, relax and enjoy a great layout of Pan Asian food. The staff is highly cooperative and seeks a lot of feedback which is a great thing. Happy eating. :)",
            "It's been a very long desire to taste the pan Asian food at Zega, very beautiful place with a spectacular view from the outlet, well balanced ambience with nice live kitchen and interactive bar, coming to the service its seems very low manned for every order we have to stand up and request someone to attend for our request, taste of the food was just ok, need to relook into the clasic dishes, over all it was a very average dining experience at zega.",
            "Was on Vacation in Shareton Hyderabad .18 04 2019 Went to ZEGA special occasion on my birthday . ambience was stirring,dim light ,soft music ,gloomy  we were in celebration mood ,we requested to taste wine before selecting  one \nfirst tasted Australian Shiraz yellow tale  ,didn't like taste much, second wine was Shiraz two ocean from Africa ,it was well seasoned wine ,liked taste half glass was  Rs1100  my Husband Ordered Beer which was ok . \nWe ordered Thai curry red chicken for main course ,it was coconut milk curry paste had taste of lime grass,basil ,some veggie like baby corn ,beans also used ,having ting of sweetness,served with little portion of rice just for one person if your tummy is empty ,thai curry tasted nice,cooked very well.\nwe also ordered starter chicken with brown sauce ,chicken was tender, sauce blended well with chicken .Overall food quality was good.made our day.As we suggested for small pastry to celebrate my birth day , they got nicely decorated plate with colourful cream say Happy Birthday cake and candle ,even clicked photo with us",

Butter-Garlic-Lime Crisp Fish and Classic Kung Pao Chicken with steamed rice were our favourites. The staff are very polite and give good suggestions which suit your food palate. Definitely worth a visit!",
            "It was an IPL Sunday evening when we went to this place, the food tastes really good unlike other 4-5 star hotel restaurants where food is average. Ambience was just ok as it was too dull according to me. The highlight of this place is its open till late night 2 am and has an amazing roof top.\nWe order 1 veg and 3 non veg starters and all were perfectly done. Specially mention for Butter garlic fish (if u like buttery flavour) which was just superb.\nThe only thing which I didn\u2019t like was the portion size which was too less.\nAnd yes you get booze served here even on dry days \ud83d\ude09",
            "Crazy place with crazy people mad over drinks \ud83c\udf78\ud83c\udf77. A place that is open late in night to havve after party scenes. Rooftop has a great feeling of its own. Ambiance is awesome. Its a party place with great music \ud83c\udfb5.\nCheers Rakshita Nath",
            "I had visited Zega on Weekdays for Lunch few times earlier and felt underwhelmed overall. Last visit for a Sunday dinner changed the perception however. First of all, the ambiance comes alive in the night with a lounge like feel, and even the otherwise boring corporate concrete jungle around seems better in the night from a height. I am guessing they put their best efforts on a weekend compared to weekdays as the food quality was significantly better. Food order was two varieties of veg sushis (the crispy one was very well made), soft noodles, and a coconut based Thai curry (which was neither too sweet nor heavy on the stomach, very well made overall). And the place was quite packed as well making it lively. Overall, worth visiting.",

            "Went to this place for lunch. Opted for a Set Menu with the on going Dim Sun Festival. Soup was good. Dim sums were awesome and they served a wide variety of Bao, Gyoza, Dim Sum, Wonton.

            "Was waiting for longtime to be @Zega with the rating it possesed. B&B, Zega Mojito,Herbal Delight,Oriental Fantasy , Blushing Dragon were ok but not that great! Chilli chicken, fish, paneer were also of subtle taste. The lamb starter should have been more soft & in eatable consistency. Egg and chicken friedrice was not having any salt. Veg Thai Curry was ok to some extent. Diff types of chicken noodles were ordered which was of average taste. Schezwan veg fried rice was below average. Somehow not satisfied with the quality of food served or the flavours or the service.Disappointing for the price paid and the food we had.",
            "I come here often. Wonderful food, lovely ambiance and most amazing staff. Try their lotus stem appetiser. We take red curry for our main course.

They really make our dining experience awesome. we will come again.",

The starter and the main course were equally good. This visit will be memorable .",

If you are craving for some home style paratas this is a really good place.",

Served with curd and green and red chutney will make you feel eat more but you can't as only one will fill you tummy. Comes in Great packaging if you order online. 15 to 20 mins is average cooking time. So less wait more taste and great value for money is all that you need.",

The satay chicken was so tender that immediately fell from the skewers and melted in the mouth, really good. The Lamb was good but not wow. The noodles tasted awesome! It came sizzling, buttery and full of flavour. Usually in India is hard to find a decent cheesecake but for our surprise this one was really good so really a good culinary experience.
